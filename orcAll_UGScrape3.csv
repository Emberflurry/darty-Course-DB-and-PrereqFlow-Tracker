AAAS,11,Introduction to African Studies,,,"This course introduces a global socio-historical framework within which to examine Africa in relation to multiple African Diasporas and notions of mobility. Considering the historical contexts of contact between Africa, Europe, and the Americas, we examine cultural, economic, and philosophic aspects of Africa. We will examine how ideas of what it means to be African culturally, racially, and politically are continually produced and contested. The moment of independence of many African nation-states from European colonial rule in the mid 20th century operates as a centering point from which we will examine economics, race, politics, and artistic expressions. We will consider ideas of “tradition” and “modernity,” representations of Africa, more recent processes of commodification, as well as various cultural and political responses to them. ",,SOC; WCult:NW,

AAAS,16,"History, Culture and Society: The Many Faces of Latin America",varies,LACS 4,"The Spanish discovery and conquest of this continent created Latin America and the Caribbean out of the diverse and complex realities of the pre-Columbian world. Since colonial times Latin American and Caribbean cultures have developed against a background of cultural repression, racial conflict, political domination, colonial exploitation, and gender inequality. And yet, in the midst of all this turmoil, Latin America and the Caribbean have produced an extraordinary variety and wealth of artistic creations, ranging from literature to the visual arts, from music to film. In this course we will turn to some of the works by Latin American and Caribbean artists and writers in an attempt to illuminate and explore some of the wonders of the cultural dynamics that shape the many faces of what we call Latin America and the Caribbean.",,LIT; WCult:NW,

AAAS,21,Racial Justice,,GOVT 27 WGSS 40.03,"This course introduces students to major contemporary racial justice debates. It also considers how theories of racial justice might better include the concerns of women of color as well as LGBT and trans persons of color. Throughout the course we will examine questions such as: What constitutes racial injustice? How is gender implicated in said injustice? What, if anything, do blacks and other people of color owe to one another? Should political possibility and pragmatism bound thinking regarding corrective racial justice?",,SOC,

This course is about Muslims in America, past, present, and future, and how American Islam is an extension of global Islam and the ways it is uniquely American. As we study religious identity and understandings of Islam in enslaved Muslim narratives, the civil rights movement, waves of immigration, pre- and post- 9/11, and the current Muslim ban, we pay close attention to theorizations of contested histories, race, gender, and class dynamics, intersectionality, model minorityhood, assimilation, discrimination, and Malcolm X’s visit to Dartmouth College, the history and the significance of the Malcolm X murals in the Shabazz building.

AAAS,23,The Black Sporting Experience,,HIST 30,"This course examines the historical and contemporary sporting experiences primarily of Black Americans. The decision to refer to this class as a “Black” experience is deliberate, as we will briefly interrogate how race and sports functions for the Black diaspora in the Caribbean, Latin America, and Europe. Despite brief examinations of the diaspora, this class uses sports history as a critical lens to understand American history.",,SOC; WCult:CI,
AAAS,24,The Black Radical Tradition in America,,HIST 037,"This course introduces major currents in the history of black radical thought, with a particular focus on the U.S. after emancipation. This class encourages students to define and evaluate radicalism in the shifting contexts of various liberation struggles. By exploring dissenting visions of social organization and alternative definitions of citizenship and freedom as expressed through nonviolence, armed rebellion, black nationalism, Pan Africanism, socialism, communism, anticolonialism, feminism, queer theory and integrationism, students will confront the meaning of the intersection of race, gender, class and sexuality in social movements.",,SOC; WCult:W,
AAAS,24.50,Contemporary Black Political Thought and the Modern World,,,"In the era and “return” of mass political social movements, the question is perhaps not what is the most urgent political struggle of today; rather, what remains unheard, unseen, and unthought in the struggle for political freedom? This course seeks to familiarize students with the works of contemporary black political thinkers who have contributed to the rich theoretical developments and productive tensions in Black Studies, discourses on black resistance and freedom struggle, and political action itself. The course focuses on several key concepts—such as civic and social death, sovereignty, the collective unconscious, the radical imagination—as a way to examine notions of agency and the psychic life of racial violence, particularly in the context of the United States. What is the dream-work of Black freedom? And how do dreams of (black) freedom become realized and/or barred from larger socio-political, economic, and legal structures to the more abstract registers of language, aesthetics, culture, and the imagination? The course investigates the theoretical tenets within contemporary Black Studies as critical theory, arguing that these are equally contributive to the continental philosophical tradition on questions of life, rights, civil society, and personhood.",,SOC; WCult:W,
AAAS,25,Constructing Black Womanhood,King,SOCY 46 and WGSS 33.01,"This course is a critical examination of the historical and contemporary status of black women in the United States, as presented in fiction, primary accounts, and social science literature. We will explore the nature, extent, and consequences of the multiple discriminations of race, sex, and class, as the context in which these women shaped their social roles and identities within the black community and the larger society.

AAAS,26,Toni Morrison,Moodie,ENGL 63.02,"This course is an in-depth study of Toni Morrison’s major fictional works. We will also read critical responses by and about the author. We will examine Morrison’s earliest and arguably most foundational and influential works. Required texts will include, The Bluest Eye, Sula, Song of Solomon, Tar Baby, Beloved, A Mercy, and Conversations with Toni Morrison. Central to our exploration will be an analysis of Morrison’s observation that “the past affects the present.” Therefore, we will explore the social and historical factors that contribute to Morrison’s artistic constructions. Some of the issues we will examine include, alternative constructions offemale community and genealogy, and representations of race, class, nationhood, and identity.",,INT or LIT; WCult:CI,
AAAS,27,Transformative Spiritual Journeys. Contemporary Memoirs of African American Religion,Booker,,"This course presents African Americans who have created religious and spiritual lives amid the variety of possibilities for religious belonging in the second half of the twentieth century and the early twenty-first century. By engaging an emerging canon of autobiographies, we will take seriously the writings of theologians, religious laity, spiritual gurus, hip hop philosophers, LGBT clergy, religious minorities, and scholars of religion as foundational for considering contemporary religious authority through popular and/or institutional forms of African American religious leadership. Themes of spiritual formation and religious belonging as a process—healing, self-making, writing, growing up, renouncing, dreaming, and liberating—characterize the religious journeys of the African American writers, thinkers, and leaders whose works we will examine. Each weekly session will also incorporate relevant audiovisual religious media, including online exhibits, documentary films, recorded sermons, tv series, performance art, and music.",,TMV; WCult:CI,
AAAS,28.10,"Race, Space, and Nature",,GEOG 40.03,"Ideas of racial difference are frequently advanced as “natural” truths about the world, linked to normative conceptions of environmental relations. Reciprocally, racism—as a set of deadly ideological and material practices articulated around purported group differences—has profoundly shaped conceptions of non-human nature. This course asks how race is inflected in the politics and practices through which humans interact with the “natural” world, and explores the implications for contemporary movements and mobilizations for environmental justice.",,SOC,
AAAS,31,"Black Theater, U.S.A.",Varies,THEA 22,"This course will examine African American playwrights, drama, and theater from 1959 to the present.

Activities include textual analysis of Wilson’s plays and related works as well as documenting and revising performance philosophy and process. While providing a safe space for exploring the roles we play in our daily lives and taking on the roles of others in given or imagined circumstances,students will learn widely accepted theories, practices, and terminology of the actor’s craft in order to facilitate the practice, writing, and discussion of acting and producing Wilson’s plays and others.",,ART; WCult:CI,

AAAS,32.01,Race and Gender in American Film,,FILM 47.24 LATS 25,"This course is an introduction to the history of race and gender in American film. These fundamental social constructs in American life have been central to the development of American film narrative from the beginnings of cinema at the turn of the twentieth century. In turn, American films have profoundly shaped the ways that we think about race and gender and racialized and gendered beings. We will analyze the shifting and situational meanings of race and gender throughout the twentieth century, and in particular, how they have been influenced by the forces of history, including wars, economic depressions, and social movements. While we will focus our attention on Hollywood cinema of the “golden age”, the period from the 1920s-1960, we will also spend significant time considering American independent cinema and the post-classical period of filmmaking from the 1960s to the present. In our consideration of race and racialized peoples, we will include African Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans and Latinos. Our discussions of gender will be expansive to include not just women and femininity, but men and masculinity as well.",,ART; WCult:W,
AAAS,32.02,Black Queer Literature and Film,,WGSS 56.12,"This seminar will combine elements of black (trans) feminist theory and black queer theory to examine the written works and films/videos by and about lesbians, bisexual, transgender, gay and queer Black people.  Emphasis will be on tracing the emergence of black literary and cinematic voices from the late twentieth century to the present.

AAAS,32.15,The Making of 21st Century Exhibits: Curating a National Black Theater Museum/Institution,Ndounou,THEA 10.55,"This course is designed for those interested in theatre and performance, African American studies, history, and culture. Students will study influences on the development of black theater and performance in the USA as well as processes for preserving, curating, and exhibiting culture in institutions, examining how museum concepts intersect and/or collide with representations of black history and culture. In collaboration with the Hattiloo Theatre in Memphis and the DeVos Institute of Arts Management, who are drafting plans for an institution devoted to black theatre practitioners, students will determine and develop content for an interactive venue.

AAAS,32.50,Black LGBTQ History,,WGSS 65.08,"This course is an introduction to the study of Black LGBTQ history in the United States. We will examine a range of primary and secondary source material from the nineteenth century through the late twentieth century. This material includes documentaries, scholarship, newspaper articles, newsletters, diaries and letters. We will look at sexual relationships in the nineteenth century among slaves and free people as well as the cultures of sexual diversity and gender transgression a couple of generations after slavery that gave rise to the jazz age and the Harlem Renaissance. We will also take a look at post-war America, the Civil Rights and Black Power era for their moments of sexual expression and gender variance as well as repression. The course will continue to examine Black experience into the AIDS crisis, gay marriage debates and transgender rights movements.",,SOC; WCult:W,
AAAS,33.10,Rituals of Breath: Black Performance and Resistance,,,"This interdisciplinary course explores the historical legacy of public rituals of extreme violence against African American peoples as both sites of anti-black state and non-state sanctioned disciplinary projects as well as time-spaces of radical resistance. From the slave trade to life and labor under conditions of slavery to post-reconstruction segregation to lynching to police violence, American history can be read through the changing nature of the public torture of Black peoples. At the center of these forms of violence are the control of breath as life force and sign of freedom. This course examines the murder of Eric Garner in 2014 in a police-executed choke hold as a key event that both harkens back to a long history of lynchings and shootings and also to a history of how Black communities have organized around and resisted these forms of violence. Aesthetic representation has been intimately connected to anti-Black racial violence from photographs and postcards of lynchings in which white perpetrators pose alongside dead Black bodies to representations of Emmitt Till’s mutilated body at his funeral in an open casket to video of Rodney King’s beating to the continuing stream of video and images of extra-judicial killings of black citizens. Generations of artists in film, theater, painting/sculpture, dance, and across media have challenged and confronted this aesthetics of violence. This course explores theories of ritual and performance to understand how artists and communities come together as collectives to contextualize and re-present impossible terrors. Artists and political organizers use aesthetics and collective action to transform the horror of being subject to violence at any moment into rituals of potential social transformation. This course then teaches students theories of ritual and performance as ways that communities have historically engaged and confronted histories of anti-Black violences in order to conceive of new future possibilities in the face of disciplinary actions meant to contain and choke black people(s). In some manner, the course links African American experiences of violence and resistance to those of other African peoples around the world. This course is team taught and also draws upon the expertise of various faculty at Dartmouth. This course aims to link theories of Black life and performance to active practices of performance-making, interrogating the intersections between art and scholarship.",,ART; WCult:CI,

AAAS,35.50,Introduction to  African American Environmental Thought: The Black Outdoors,Bennett,ENGL 53.29,"The persistence of black life, and blackness as a way of thinking about the organization of both human and nonhuman forms of life, has been absolutely central to the story of the United States and the Americas more broadly. This course provides an interdisciplinary exploration of the writing of thinkers from across the African diaspora, with special emphasis on literary works and criticism centrally concerned with the intersections of black literary studies and African American environmental thought. We will draw on a range of texts in order to wrestle with some of the key concerns of African American writers from the 19th century through the present. Students will be introducedto a range of methods and approaches to the meta-disciplinary work of black literary studies. By the end of the course, students will be expected to possess a working knowledge of several major themes, figures and moments within the black expressive tradition.",,LIT; WCult:W,
AAAS,35.60,Poetry for the People,Bennett,ENGL 53.48,"The central concern of this class is the historical relationship between the social lives of everyday people and U.S. American poetics, with a special emphasis on what June Jordan once termed the “difficult miracle of Black poetry in America.” How does poetry help us to know one another? And how might we better understand the particular role of poetry, of poesis, for those historically barred from the very practice of reading or writing, from ownership (even of one’s own body), and various generally recognized forms of belonging? For the purposes of this course, these will be some of our animating questions.",,LIT; WCult:CI,
AAAS,36.50,Rasta and Rastafari,Campbell,,"This course examines the Rastafari spiritual and political movement from its genesis in Jamaica to its transformation into a global phenomenon. Today’s perception of Rastafari is informed by popular images of marijuana smoking, reggae musicians and a laid-back lifestyle. Consequently, Rasta is often mistaken for practicing a countercultural phenomenon of no global significance, a poster child for the undesirable other, or merely a misguided rebel. Rastafari however, is significantly more profound. Rastafari has offered, cloaked in revolutionary black hermeneutics, some of the sharpest critiques against European imperialism and exploitation. Despite the presence of burgeoning scholarship, Rasta’s global significance remains hidden in the fissures of most historical discourses and behind the haze of marijuana smoke created by popular understandings of the movement. This course employs monographs, scholarly articles, documentary films and primary sources and music to and explore Rastafarian ideologies that among other things, promoted decolonization while decrying racism and imperialism. It is open to students seeking to broaden their knowledge of religions and socio-political movements in the African diaspora.",,WCult:NW,

AAAS,39.05,Utility of Death and Dying in African American Music,,,"This course explores the topics of death and dying and their multiple uses across the span of African American music from the time of enslavement to the present day. Through an engagement with sound recordings, scholarly writings, journalism, lyrical analysis, film, and other sources, we will expand our understanding of how and why death is so frequently invoked in African American music.  Although some reasons for these invocations - for instance, loss or mourning – may seem obvious, this course will require us to reframe our perceptions of death as simply the ending point of life. As we will learn, death and dying can serve a number of purposes, from ‘deadness’ serving as a necessary aesthetic for creation, to death being an integral part of an artist’s identity.",,ART; WCult:W,
AAAS,39.06,Hip-Hop in the United States,Martin,MUS 18.02,"This course is an introduction to hip-hop music and culture, intended to offer interdisciplinary perspectives on what is one of the most popular genres in the United States. From its humble origins in New York to now, hip-hop and rap music have changed the sonic landscape of the US and the world. We will examine rap music and hip-hop culture as artistic and sociological phenomena with emphasis on historical, cultural, economic and political contexts.  Discussions will include the coexistence of various hip-hop styles, their appropriation by the music industry, and controversies resulting from the exploitation of hip-hop music and culture as a commodity for national and global consumption.",,ART; WCult:CI,

We will look at women's experiences of social change in African religions, the encounter with Islam, slavery, Christianity, and colonialism. We will analyze the articulations of economic and political power or lack of power in religious ideas as we ask questions such as: What are the different antecedents and circumstances in which women exercise or are denied agency, leadership, power and happiness in their communities?

With a focus on Africa and its diaspora, the course looks at the movement of people and ideas inherent in the concept of diaspora and reflects on how people also reshape social worlds that challenge the way we commonly understand the world to be divided (i.e. by political territories like “countries” or by physical geographies like “continents”). The goal of the course is to start with the concept of “Blackness” and unpack the complexity of various other racial and spatial categories like “Sub-Saharan Africa” “Arab North Africa” “the West” and “diaspora.” The three general themes of territory, flows, and space/futurisms, will be explored in relation to the way they are experienced by people in everyday life, therefore the readings will primarily be ethnographic, following African descendant communities in Africa, Europe and the Americas.

To understand the island’s history, students are expected to read what historians and writers have written about Haiti; and to read the primary letters of frantic French planters, rebellious African slaves, egalitarian peasants, entrepreneurial market women, conscientious revolutionaries, exuberant military generals, loquacious politicians, feared dictators, and dreaded militias through time. The course will, indeed, move through four important, though overlapping, historical moments. First, we begin with an examination of the 1791-1804 Haitian Revolution when enslaved Africans revolted against the French colonial planters to successfully abolish slavery and to achieve national independence. Second, we read through the formation of grassroots and institutional democratic traditions in the nineteenth century and how they were undone during the 1915-1934 US Occupation of Haiti, where US President Woodrow Wilson ordered the American military to invade Haiti and control the island for almost two decades. Third, we will explore how the undoing of democracy led to the rise of the Francois and Jean-Claude Duvalier dictatorship (1957-1971) and its dreaded militia called the tonton makout militia (often spelled in the following French orthography: tonton macoutes). Finally, we will conclude the class by looking at how and why the Haitian peasantry overthrew the dictatorship to replace it with the democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide (1991).",,SOC; WCult:NW,

Diverse sciences have established that human beings are well over 99% genetically identical, but race remains a potent vision through division that has been made and made to matter across multiple spheres of life.

This dislocation manifests itself not only with respect to space, but also in relationship to history, language, political power, and above all in the psychological relationship that diasporic subjects maintain with themselves. This course will focus on two primary examples of diaspora in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Jews and Africans, to examine the multiplicity of relationships among language, literary structure, as well as gender and sexuality that inform the construction of diasporic literatures. Although this course cannot be comprehensive in its survey of either Jewish or African literatures, it will offer suggestive juxtapositions of the two to emphasize commonalities between their historical and political experience.

The themes, Body, Voice, Memory, and Movement provide a center from which discussions of agency, representation and counter-narrative can be situated within a larger discourse of canon formation. We will explore various parts of the United States and the Caribbean through analyses of literature and visual culture, paying particular attention to shifting dialogues of culture and identity. Among the central questions posed will be: What constitutes a feminist ideology in black women’s literature?

In this course we will examine gendered constructions of self- portraiture as they exist in poetry, memoir, and photography. Specifically, our task will be to examine the registers of possibility present when women use their bodies and stories to claim authorial space.

The City of Light is arguably one of the most beautiful and exciting destinations in the world. However, all that glitters is not gold. Matters of race and anti-blackness co-exist with a variety of myths, narratives, and representations of Paris and France as color-blind and race-free.

This narrative is one that continues to ignore the African presence, now on French soil for centuries, as does it consider its Black and Muslim citizens as second-class. Moreover, to French society, racism became an opinion rather than an ideology and the colonial past a forgotten chapter with the collapse of the French colonial empire in 1962 at the end of the war in Algeria. Yet, reports and studies from governmental and non-governmental antiracism associations document and denounce the existence of racial discrimination and racism in everyday life, which echo past representations and practices. Indeed, social and cultural movements continue to question silences on the colonial past and how it facilitates anti-Black racism. In this course, we will explore how the coloniality of republican power – the ways in which processes of racialization continue to operate and to create spaces of greater vulnerability – are rooted in a historical context of slavery that continues to operate after 1962 as well as the counter-narratives and cartographies that have emerged in response.",,SOC; WCult:CI,

The Black Arts Movement had far-reaching implications for the way artists and writers think about race, history, authorship, and the relationship between artistic production and political liberation. We'll explore these issues in work by Amiri Baraka, Sonia Sanchez, Larry Neal, and others who forged the traditionally-defined Black Arts Movement in Harlem. We'll also trace the movement's flowering around country, where local political struggles and artistic traditions in Chicago, Newark, Los Angeles, and Detroit shaped distinctive regional variations of the Black Arts Movement.

We will use a critical eye to explore the conditions of possibility that allow states, development organizations, donor agencies, and individuals to unwittingly reproduce centuries-old tropes of poverty, degradation, and helplessness of non-Western peoples. Examining various institutionally structured encounters between Europeans and non-Western peoples we unpack assumptions about the naturalness of power.

Delving into some of these contexts and engaging many of these artists’ larger oeuvre, this course is a multidisciplinary investigation of major protest poets of the twentieth century. It explores the ways in which poets living in the United States, and particularly members of historically marginalized communities, not only pushed back at the powers-that-be, but continuously saw and articulated themselves as simultaneously a part of and a part from larger “American” society. The course wrestles with the well-known and often contentious topics: race, class, and gender. Starting with turn-of-the-century writers like Claude McKay—whose words have become synonymous with outspoken critiques of World War I and the “Red Scare”—and ending with contemporary writers like Balakian and Chin, the course moves chronologically.

As the first Africans in the New World to achieve this feat, Maroon warriors directly and indirectly influenced abolitionist and revolutionary movements throughout the Americas—including, of course, revolts in Haiti and the United States. These warriors continued to inspire the revolutionary actions of other oppressed and/or enslaved individuals for generations, and indeed, a revolutionary ethos pervades Jamaican culture and artistic production from the colonial period to the present moment.

ARTH,10.02,Art and Archaeology of Israel,,JWST 41,"This course will examine the archeology of Israel from prehistory through the early Roman period, with emphasis on cultural interactions and their material manifestations. Ancient Israel was a crossroads where many different cultures met. Home to Canaanites and Israelites, Israel successively experienced the cultural and artistic impact of Egyptians, Assyrians, Greeks, and Romans, who either invaded this region or came into contact with it through a variety of more peaceful processes.",,ART; WCult:NW,
ARTH,10.03,Art in Egypt,Kangas ,,"Mummies, pyramids, curses and death, these are some of the images and associations that one conjures up with the mention of ancient Egypt today. Ancient Egyptian civilization is an endlessly fascinating field for intellectual inquiry and debate, the subject of spectacular museum displays, as well as a source of inspiration for various reenactments in literature and film. The modern attraction for Egypt has its origins in Napoleon’s invasion of the country in 1798, and later, and more profoundly, in the 1922 discovery of the tomb of king Tutankhamen in the Valley of the Kings. However, already in the ancient world, the Greeks and Romans expressed fascination for the monuments and the civilization of Egypt, primarily as they experienced its material culture through travel and other cultural exchanges. In this course we will study key works of art and architecture in ancient Egypt as well as explore some important instances in the subsequent reception of Egyptian monuments, history, and mythology.",,ART; WCult:NW,

ARTH,12.02,Roman Architecture,,,"Architecture played a central role in ancient Rome’s ascent to imperial world power. Buildings like bathhouses, aqueducts and villas built around the Mediterranean basin helped spread Roman culture across both time and space; temples and shrines assured that Romans everywhere could pray to a common roster of gods; likewise, roads connected the cosmopolitan cities of the empire. In this class, we will look at the variety of built types, construction materials and building techniques that the Romans adopted from about 500 BC to 400 AD.",,ART; WCult:W,

ARTH,21.03,Rembrandt,,,"Rembrandt van Rijn was Holland’s preeminent artist in the seventeenth century. This course considers Rembrandt’s extraordinary achievements as an etcher, focusing especially on the artist’s highly imaginative and experimental use of the etching medium, the broad range of subjects and expressive power of the prints, as well as the functions the prints served in Rembrandt’s time. All our classes will make use of the Hood Museum's superb collection of Rembrandt prints, thus allowing students to do first-hand study of the artist's original works.",,,
ARTH,22.01,Velazquez and the Spanish Baroque,,,"Diego Velasquez, sometimes called the prince of painters, was Spain's preeminent artist in the seventeenth century. This course considers his achievements as a painter, his aspirations as a courtier and gentleman, and his remarkably privileged association with his patron, King Philip IV.

ARTH,27.01,The Ideal City,Kassler-Taub,,"This course explores the Renaissance phenomenon of the “ideal city” – its origins, successes, and spectacular failures. During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, major artists and architects like Leonardo da Vinci participated in a radical experiment that transformed how urban spaces were designed, represented, and built. The Renaissance city was reinvented as a utopia, featuring straight processional avenues, a rigid street plan, and monumental sculptures inserted into public squares like props on a stage. We will consider a wide range of case studies, from fictional cities imagined in the pages of sketchbooks to new cities and towns that were built from the ground up. Throughout, we will question how architects exploited the basic infrastructure of daily life – roads, gates, walls, squares, and even sewage systems – to perfect their environments. How were those principles used to promote civic virtue and good governance or to reinforce social hierarchies and absolutist rule? We will make frequent visits to the Rauner Special Collections Library to work directly with rare books. The course requires no prior knowledge of art history, architecture, or the Renaissance.",,ART,
ARTH,27.02,Living Stone: Sculpture in Early Modern Italy,Kassler-Taub,,"Early modern sculptors like Michelangelo and Bernini pushed the boundaries of their craft, blurring the line between illusion and reality. Through bold experiments, marble was transformed into flesh, bronze into fluid fabric, and stucco into weightless clouds. The labor of chiseling, casting, modeling, and carving became a testing ground for larger debates in the arts. What is the relationship between the ‘dirty work’ of sculpture and artistic inspiration? Can an artist truly imitate a living, breathing body? This course will consider major changes in how sculpture was designed, experienced, and understood between the years 1400 and 1800. Our focus will be on artists and workshops in Italy with comparisons to other geographies. Topics to be considered include: originality and the sculptural copy; urban sculpture and fountains; the monumental and the miniature; gender, sexuality, and the sculpted body; materials and materiality; and theories of enlivenment.",,ART; WCult:W,
ARTH,27.03,Building Boom: Architecture and Urbanism in Early Modern Italy,Kassler-Taub,,"Across early modern Italy, architects and engineers broke ground on construction projects that transformed cities like Rome, Florence, Venice, and Naples into bustling urban centers. New building technologies and design innovations yielded monumental palaces, soaring devotional spaces, and vast streets and squares. Italy’s building boom was fueled by the consolidation of political and economic power in the hands of ambitious patrons for whom architecture was a vehicle of self-fashioning. This course explores Italian architecture and urbanism of the Renaissance and Baroque periods, with a focus on the socio-political and cultural dynamics that shaped the theory and practice of building between the fifteenth through eighteenth centuries. Subjects to be considered include: classicism and the memory of antiquity; treatises and the architectural book; building as propaganda; stylistic experimentation and architectural ornament; villa culture; and designs for the stage. The course will include visits to Rauner Library and the Hood Museum of Art to work with early modern books, prints, and drawings.",,ART; WCult:W,
ARTH,28.01,The Global Renaissance,Kassler-Taub,,"The movement to globalize the field of art history has dramatically changed how we understand the phenomenon traditionally called “the Renaissance.” This course gives students an opportunity to question how the European canon of Renaissance ‘masterworks’ was constructed, and what it overlooks. By expanding beyond the Italian centers of Florence, Rome, and Venice, we will take a global approach to the visual and architectural culture of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Each week will consider a region typically marginalized in Renaissance studies – including the Americas, Africa, and Asia – to explore how trends in art making and architectural design evolved across distant geographies. How do the dominant narratives of exploration, discovery, and invention intersect with the histories of colonialism, slavery, and economic upheaval? How did diverse local practices, identities, and voices leave their mark on the period? Throughout, we will consider topics such as: the exchange of models, techniques, and materials between foreign workshops; theories of circulation and exchange; and the relationship between so-called artistic ‘centers’ and their peripheries.",,INT or ART; WCult:W,
ARTH,28.02,Going for Baroque,,,"This course surveys the principal monuments of painting, sculpture and printmaking produced in Europe during the seventeenth century, the age of the Baroque.  Considered within the broader political, religious, and social context of the period, these artistic achievements will be discussed thematically, according to types of subject matter and in relation to issues that were of particular interest to artists, such as naturalism and the engagement of the viewer, the passage of time, and the transforming power of light. The course will explore the ways religious and political institutions exploited the arts for their own propagandistic ends, and examine as well how images of the period satisfied patrons’ interests in the familiar and exotic, optical illusions, and spectacle and drama.  Among the artists whose works will be discussed are Caravaggio, Bernini, Artemisia Gentileschi, Velazquez, Rembrandt, Vermeer, Jan Steen and Poussin.",,ART; WCult:W,
ARTH,28.03,Vision and Reality: The Art of Northern Europe in the Fifteenth Century,,," The fifteenth century in northern Europe is an amalgam of influences that form our idea of the modern. The concerns and styles of the Late Gothic are present, mixing with new forms of technology, such as printing or the perfection of oil painting techniques. The weakened grip of the Church contributes to the emerging emphasis on the individual that characterizes Early Modern art. The fifteenth century sees the rise of secular art, the concept of objective realism, the development of panel painting, the commercialization of prints, and the beginnings of independent portraiture. My goal is to give you the knowledge and skills that will enable you to understand and appreciate the nuances and complexity in fifteenth-century artworks wherever you encounter them. In addition to the mastery of scholarly materials, you will work on reading visual culture, practicing your writing skills and perfecting your oral communication.     Our focus will be on reception, context and invention.",,ART,
ARTH,28.04,Reform and Response in Sixteenth-century Northern Europe,,,"In 1517 Martin Luther nailed the 95 Theses to the door of the castle chapel in Wittenberg. That act was the culmination of decades of frustration with an established Church that, to many believers, had lost its way. What followed was a European debate for the very souls of men. The Reformation brought into question the assumptions by which most Europeans had lived—that the Church’s teachings, personal good actions, and Christ’s sacrifice could insure their salvation. Using the printing press and artworks, both sides presented their positions in propagandistic language that could be both bombastic and subtle. We will look at this central event in the shaping of free will, and how it played out in the art created in Northern Europe at that time.",,ART; WCult:W,
ARTH,28.05,Art & Society in the Age of the Rococo,O'Rourke,,"This course explores the transformative period in European art and culture between 1700 and 1800, when the playful decadence of the Rococo gave way to the morally purified art of Neoclassicism. We will study the “high arts” of painting, sculpture & architecture in the context of an expanded realm of visual culture, including interior design and decorative objects, clothing and fashion, hairstyles and luxury goods, the art market and the print trade.  We will investigate the political and social uses of art at the time paying special attention to alternative discourses of power spoken through fashion, gesture and influence. We will examine court culture, the new public sphere, the growth of the middle class, the Grand Tour, the expanded role of women in the 18th century as patrons and artists, and the socio-political changes leading up to the French Revolution. Artists include Hogarth, Watteau, Boucher, Kauffman, Reynolds, Adam, Greuze, among others.",,ART; WCult:W,
ARTH,28.06,European Art in the Age of Revolution (1750-1850),Hornstein,,"Visual arts were transformed in the second half of the eighteenth and first half of the nineteenth century by dramatic upheavals in social, political and cultural life. In addition to taking account of stylistic movements such as Rococo, Neo-classicism and Romanticism, we will devote our attention to relationships between artistic and social change, political and institutional pressures upon artists, changing ideas of art’s purpose and audience, and artists’ shift to direct engagement with modern life.",,ART; WCult:W,
ARTH,28.07,Art Writing and Writers on Art,O'Rourke,COLT 61.01,"This course will explore the various modes of writing on or about art and artists from the early modern to the modern period in Europe. Focusing primarily on writers and texts from France, Germany and Italy, we will consider the social and cultural roles of the artist and art works as they were formulated, investigated and reinterpreted throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. The classical revival and the beginnings of “modern” art history, the growth of the periodical press and the explosion of art (and literary) criticism, the growing public sphere for art, the biographical tendency in historical writing, and Romantic fantasies of the artist all worked to create a rich body of literary or quasi-literary writings on art and artists at this time.",,ART; WCult:W,
ARTH,28.08,Italian Art from Renaissance to Baroque: Crisis and Invention,Kassler-Taub ,,"In studios and workshops across early modern Italy, artists developed new forms, styles, and ideas that transformed how they responded to the changing world around them. With a focus on the years between 1400 and 1700, this course will consider the cultural dynamics that gave the arts new meaning and urgency and fueled innovations in Italian cities large and small. Taking a chronological approach to the Renaissance and Baroque periods, we will consider topics such as: self-fashioning and identity; the role of art in moments of ideological or political crisis; the dialogue between art and technology; and visual drama and deception. We will explore a wide range of objects, from the private pages of sketchbooks to painted ceilings, and from colossal sculptures to viral prints. Throughout, we will question how artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Titian, Caravaggio, and Bernini manipulated diverse materials and theorized the process of invention. The course will include frequent visits to the Hood Museum of Art and the Rauner Special Collections Library.",,ART; WCult:W,
ARTH,28.09,Art on the Move: Renaissance Italy and the Islamic World,Kassler-Taub,MES 18.02,"During the Renaissance, innovations in art and architecture constantly moved back and forth between Italy and the Islamic world. New design models, styles of ornamentation, and even building methods became part of a shared artistic and architectural language that crossed cultural and geographical boundaries in the Mediterranean. This introductory course will focus on exchanges between Italian centers such as Venice, Florence, and Pisa and the Mamluk Sultanate, the Safavid Empire, and the Ottoman Empire between the fall of Constantinople (1453) and the Battle of Lepanto (1571). We will consider a wide range of case studies, including: the role of the traveling painter and architect in foreign courts; the trade in luxury goods such as textiles and ceramics; common trends in villa and garden culture; and the re-appropriation of objects and monuments. How did such a rich history of cross-cultural contact emerge against a backdrop of military strife, political rivalry, and religious tension? To answer this question, we will explore contemporary theories of artistic mobility, hybridity, and influence. The course will include an excursion to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, as well as visits to the Rauner Special Collections Library and the Hood Museum of Art.",,ART; WCult:W,

No background in Asian or South Asian art is necessary.",,ART; WCult:NW,
ARTH,31.02,"Art and Industry: The Visual and Material Culture of South Asia, 1800 to present",,,"This course examines the relationship between art and industry through the visual and material culture of South Asia from 1800 to the present. The first third of the course will focus on the colonial discourse of art and economy, and the fear that industrial production would destroy indigenous craft and design. This instigated a colonial system of education, and the creation of museums, that taught both the European ‘fine arts’ of painting and sculpture, and the Indian ‘applied arts’ of craft and design in practice and in objects. The second third of the course will attend to specific media as physical and intellectual conduits in the economy. We will discuss the explosive effect of the technologies of print and photography in colonial control and nationalist agitation. We will also examine the materiality of textiles, clay, wood, metal, plastic, paper, and food in their production, exhibition display, and cultural and political context. The last third of the course will focus on modern artists’ considerations of art and craft, the formation of national museums, and the contemporary art market. In parallel to the attention to visual and material objects, we will read selections from primary sources on art and industry, such as George C. Birdwood’s Industrial Arts of India (1880), The Journal of Indian Art and Industry, Mahatma Gandhi’s Hind Swaraj (1909), and K. G. Subrahmanyan’s Eclecticism (1992).",,INT or ART; WCult:NW,

We will look at Goguryeo mural paintings, Goryeo Buddhist Paintings, and Joseon landscapes, portraits, genre, and folk paintings, as well as Korea’s modern and contemporary art, including North Korean propaganda posters. We will ask questions like: How have Korean paintings reflected changes in religious beliefs, political idealogy, and material culture? What quintessential aesthetica values (if any) are found in Korean painting? How much does contemporary “global” Korean painting contain the legacy of the Korean painting tradition?",,ART; WCult:NW,

The pan-Asiatic nature and long historical development of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam affords opportunities to examine national and sectarian adaptations of architectural practices. This course has no prerequisites and assumes no prior experience with Asian religions or architectural studies.",,INT or ART; WCult:NW,
ARTH,38.02,Contemporary Arts of Asia,,,"This course examines the contemporary art of Asia from a variety of historical, cultural, and critical perspectives. Lectures, readings and discussions range across broad themes such as identity, globalization, trans-nationalism, and feminism and include examination of both traditional and new media. Case studies examine the work of both well-established and emerging young artists. This course is designed to equip students with the critical skills necessary to appreciate, discuss, and analyze contemporary Asian art.",,ART; WCult:NW,
ARTH,38.03,East Meets West,Kim,ASCL 70.02,"This class explores the interaction between the cultures of East Asia and the West from as early as c. 200 BCE to the early 20th century. The course consists largely of four themes: the Silk Road and the Arts, the Pottery Stories, the Jesuits and the Arts, and Asian Arts in Europe. The class starts with the Silk Road, the world’s first great superhighway that from ancient times linked East Asia to the Mediterranean World across Central Asia, and examines how ideas, art, and religions traveled and were transformed through their journey. The second theme, the Porcelain stories, conveys how aesthetics, technology, designs and motifs were transmitted from East to West and vice versa. We will ask questions, such as: Why was porcelain so desirable? Where did porcelain rank in the hierarchy of art forms and materials in Asia and Europe? How much did a piece of porcelain cost at any moment in time? Why did Japan and Korea have “the Pottery War” and what was the significance of that war in East Asia (and Europe)? The third theme, the Jesuits and the Arts, looks at the hybrid blend of two or more traditions and the artistic productions that arose from those blends. We also will examine together the paintings of Asian and European artists, the paintings of European artists on Asian themes with a traditional Asian medium, and the work of Asian painters’ on European subject matter with a European medium. The last theme, Asian art in Europe, scrutinizes the Western reception of Asian subjects, motifs, designs, and aesthetic values, and their appropriation for artistic productions. European interpretation (or imitation) of Chinese arts, so called Chinoiseries, and the Japanese influence on European art, known as Japonism, will be closely examined. Through lectures, readings, and films, we will explore the historical and artistic links between East and West and some selected art associated with those routes. This course requires no previous experience, but is intended for those who like interdisciplinary approaches to art and culture. No previous coursework is required.",,ART; WCult:NW,
ARTH,38.04,Food & Art: A Global History,Camerlenghi,,"""This is a global history of food’s relation to art. We will examine food and art across multiple geographies and times, and methodologies. Topics will include cookbooks and menus; utensils and ceramics; plastics and lunchboxes; migrations of plants, dishes, and cooks; religious fasts and feasts; gardens, still-lives, the appetite; Pop art of food; activist food art; food labels and ephemera; terroir and the taste of place.""",,INT or ART,
ARTH,40.01,American Art and Identity,Coffey,,"Where is America? What makes America distinct? How have images of America helped to define and challenge our ideas about who “we” are? In this course we study how paintings, photographs, monuments, and other forms of visual culture have shaped the America we know today. We will trace the emergence of U.S.-American art and identity from the point of Encounter, through Independence, and up to the Centennial Celebrations of Columbus’ “discovery of America” in 1893 through discreet comparisons with developments in Mexico, and Canada. The course is organized chronologically around a series of themes that foreground the intersection between class, race, gender, and nation-building. Students will learn how to identify and analyze the key genres and styles of 19th century American art, including portraiture, photography, ledger drawing, monuments, and landscape, history, and genre painting. They will consider how character and class are constructed through the portrait; how the claims of settler nationalism are naturalized through landscape; how anxieties about racial emancipation, immigration, and gender advancement are managed through images of the “people;” how war both consolidated and radically challenged prevailing conceptions of American identity; and how minoritized populations challenged the dominant construction of “America” throughout this period. There are no pre-requisites for this course. It has been designed as an introduction to the field of American art history as well as to the discipline of Art History more generally. First year students and non-majors are welcome.",,ART; WCult:CI,
ARTH,40.02,The American Century: Modern Art in the United States,Coffey,,"What made the 20th century the “American Century”? In this course we will examine how painting, sculpture, photography, public murals, and monuments contributed to the political and economic rise and cultural dominance of the United States in the 20th century. Find out: how artists from the US and Mexico contributed to the search for the “Americanness” of American art; how African-Americans, Native Americans, Latino/as, women, and queer Americans have contributed to and challenged the image of America they created; how artists participated in the Cold War; and in turn, how the Cultural Cold War spawned a radical counter-culture and a new “culture war” over identity in the 1990s. In this course, students will develop a basic understanding of the development of U.S. American art—the major figures, movements, and themes—over the course of the 20th century; learn how to visually analyze and write about works of art executed in different media and for different viewing contexts; learn how to locate a specific artist’s handling of a subject, theme, or motif within a particular socio-political context and be able to compare and contrast different artistic expressions of a subject, theme, or motif across time, develop a more nuanced understanding of social movements in the 20th century United States, develop a greater appreciation for the contributions of minoritized groups to American art, culture, and history; question received notions of “American” culture and identity; and engage in productive discussion about the strategic value, situated meaning, and intersectionality of nation, class, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and identity.

ARTH,40.03,Twentieth Century Art from Latin America,Coffey,LACS 78,"This course is an introductory survey of art produced by artists living in Latin and Latin@ America during the 20th century. We will approach this topic through case studies of the major figures and movements in the cosmopolitan centers of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, Uruguay, and the U. S. We will treat Latin America as a geopolitical construct rather than an essential unity. Throughout the course we will be attentive to the distinctive character of the different national histories, populations, and cultural traditions that have shaped artistic production in this region while still acknowledging points of convergence, influence, and shared conviction among them. We will examine how national identity, racial formation, class difference, gender inequality, political struggle, and state violence have been addressed by artists from the region and in diaspora. Students will learn about the major figures, movements, and genres of Latin and Latin@ American art: such as, modernismo, muralism, social realism, surrealism, geometric abstraction, kinetecism, and neo-concretismo, Latin American pop and conceptual art, installation, performance, and exhibition practices. They will develop an appreciation for the racialized modernisms of many Latin American countries and an ability to compare and contrast different iterations of hybridity from Mexican Indigenismo, to afro-Cubanismo, to Brazilian Anthropophagism (cannibalism), among others. They will develop an appreciation for how artists from Latin America have intervened in international avant-garde discourses by developing “ex-centric” strategies or ethics of avant-gardism. And they will explore the critical and reciprocal relationship between Latin American modernisms and state modernization and authoritarianism. This course has no pre-requisites and is accessible to both majors and non-majors. Students need no prior knowledge about Art History or Latin American art and history.",,ART; WCult:CI,
ARTH,40.04,Mexicanidad: Constructing and Dismantling Mexican National Identity,Coffey,LACS 30.09,"Since the Mexican Revolution (1910-17), artists, intellectuals, and state-actors have endeavored to define and re-define Mexican national identity, or what is known as Mexicanidad. From the 1920s and 30s, when an emphasis was placed on Mexico’s rural and indigenous populations to the 1940s and 50s, when greater attention was given to Mexican modernization, through the years after 1968, when artists and intellectuals endeavored to reveal the repressive nature of Mexicanidad and its role in propagandizing an authoritarian state and ruling party. In this course we will place artists like José Clemente Orozco and Frida Kahlo within a broader visual cultural context that includes not only mural art and painting, but also sculpture, architecture, printmaking, photography, installation, film, and performance. We will cover art produced in Mexico from the turn of the 20th century through the “boom” years of the 1990s, with a focus on issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality throughout. Students will learn about the history of Mexican art, enhance skills in the visual analysis of modern and contemporary art, refine their ability to conduct original research and write effectively, and develop an understanding of how visual culture participates in the construction of national identity as well as how art can critique and queer that construction. This course has no pre-requisites and requires no prior knowledge of Art History or Mexican art and history.",,ART; WCult:CI,
ARTH,40.05,Latinx Art & Activist Print Media,,LATS 012,"Since the late 1960s, printmaking and print cultures have been at the center of constructing identity discourses for Latinx communities in the United States. Through the analysis of prints, political graphics, comics, zines, and ephemera, we will study how the printed image negotiates relations of power. From posters of United Farm Worker boycotts and broadsides of the Young Lords to contemporary prints that narrate stories of migration and belonging, we will delve into graphic media and consider notions of authorship (collective/individual), activism, display, dissemination, consumption, collecting, and technology. Students will learn to think critically and empathetically about how these collective modes of art-making foreground the politics of representation: what we see, how we see, who gets to control our image, and how can printed multiples challenge those narratives. Students will enhance their skills in visual analysis and writing, gain experience in collaborative printmaking, and refine their ability to conduct original research.

ARTH,41.01,Modernism and Modernity: Art in late nineteenth-century France,Hornstein,,"From 1848 to 1914, French art and the modern city of Paris dominated the international art scene. This course explores the radical visual culture of the period in painting, sculpture, prints and photography, from the realism of Courbet and Manet to the abstraction of Seurat and Cézanne. We will focus on how new technologies, political and social revolutions, and exhibition culture influenced the work of Cassatt, Degas, Monet, Renoir, Van Gogh and Rodin, among others.",,ART; WCult:W,

We will examine “avant-garde” artistic practice as a cultural phenomenon, studying individual artists and their associated movements (Cubism, Futurism, Constructivism, Dad, Surrealism) through themes such as artistic responses to mass culture; new forms of technology; representations of sexual, racial, and class identity; and the relationship between art, nationalism, war and revolution.",,ART; WCult:W,
ARTH,41.03,European Art 1750-1850,,,"European culture was transformed during the period 1750-1850. The absolutist monarchy established by Louis XIV would end with the traumatic rupture of the French Revolution. Napoleon redrew the map of Europe. The aristocracies that had ruled the West for a millennium, withered as the bourgeoisie and working classes struggled for control. The optimism of the Enlightenment slowly soured into the brooding inwardness of Romantic melancholia. The rise of mass industrial production and consumption would be accompanied by waves of technological and social change that irrevocably altered daily life. European powers pursued global dominance through colonial expansion with renewed vigor and brutality. This course examines these epochal changes through the lends of European cultural production, covering key artistic movements such as the Rococo, Neoclassicism, Romanticism, and Realism. We will closely analyze major works of art and visual culture alongside primary, historical texts of the period. These will be supplemented with recent scholarship that will help situate the works under investigation within the rich and complex social and intellectual milieu in which they were produced.",,ART; WCult:W,
ARTH,41.04,European Art: 1850-1900,,,"This course will survey the history of European art the second half of the nineteenth century in a variety of media: painting, sculpture, print media, architecture and design. This is a rich and fascinating period of art-making as well as cultural and technological transformation \u2015a period during which political instability, industrialization, colonialism, and the growth of popular culture had an enormous impact on the production, style, and presentation of art. Old systems of patronage and institutional control over artists dissolved, leaving them to experiment with how to give form to “modernity,” and how to address a widening public audience for their art. Lectures and readings will shift between broad themes in 19th-century art coupled with in-depth examination of singular works, the goal being to strike a balance between close attention to art’s formal means and an account of what its chosen subject matter may have meant, to the artists themselves and to their public.",,ART; WCult:W,
ARTH,42.01,Unmaking History: Contemporary Art in the Middle East,Elias,,"This course focuses primarily on the work of contemporary artists who make work in or about the so-called Middle East. It includes recent works by artists from nations as diverse as Algeria, Iran, Israel, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, Turkey and the UAE. One of the main objectives of the course is to look at art practices that attempt to deepen our understanding of the varied cultures, ethnicities and societies that are found in this part of the world. The geographic focus of the course–mostly the Muslim nations of the Arabian peninsula and North Africa–is not meant to perpetuate the assumptions about this region as a monolithic geopolitical entity, nor to blindly label its production according to existing ethnic, religious or national categories. Against media stereotypes of the region, the artists studied in this course have made work that function as a critical platform for rethinking traditional identity formations and extending the space of cultural encounter across borders (territorial, political, linguistic). In many cases these artists may not be living and working in their country of birth but their ethnicity, religion or citizenship continues to inform both their own sense of identity and the terms of their art practice. Some of the topics to be discussed include: artistic responses to the Arab-Israeli conflict, representations of everyday life in times of war, the movement and obstruction of people, goods and information across borders, the rise of new art markets in the Middle East, the politics of gender and sexuality in the Arab world, and the of use archival documents to rethink the meaning of evidence, truth and testimony.",,ART; WCult:NW,

ARTH,47.02,Modern Architecture,Heck,,"Architectural historians disagree about the origins of the modern era. For many, “modern” suggests principally the built works of the twentieth century. Others find the great projects of the nineteenth-century industrial revolution a more suitable place to begin. Still others—as will we—push the beginnings of “modern” architectural thought and practice back to the late eighteenth century. In this way we place architectural transformation in the context of the great changes taking place in the political, artistic, social and intellectual life of the period. This course approaches architecture as a cultural product and investigates the relationship between buildings, the ideas embodied in buildings and the cultures that designed them. We will chart the history of modern design from the Age of Enlightenment to the present.",,ART; WCult:W,

ARTH,48.04,Women in Art,,,"This course will explore the complex and varied roles of women in the arts: as artists, patrons, “muses,” and cultural critics. We will examine the structural conditions of art making in the academy and the studio, the market and the exhibition. We will investigate gendered notions of genius, creativity and originality, including the status of women artists as “exceptional.” Looking also at the female nude in Western art and feminist art in post-modernism, we will analyze the roles that femininity and masculinity play in modernism. With a focus mostly on the 18th-20th c., major figures include Artemisia Gentileschi and Judith Leyster, Mme de Pompadour, Elisabeth Vigée-LeBrun, Mary Cassatt, Berthe Morisot, Frida Kahlo, Barbara Kruger and Cindy Sherman, among others.",,ART; WCult:W,
ARTH,48.05,"Satire: Art, Politics & Critique",O'Rourke,,"Satire has been used since antiquity as a powerful form of political, social and cultural critique. With humor, sarcasm, and often biting criticism, satire goes beyond pure comedy to speak with a moral voice. The targets of satire range from the world of fashion and the everyday to that of politics and high culture. We will examine case studies of satirical production, from the 18th century through the late 20th century, from the darkly comic prints of Hogarth and Daumier, to the overtly humorous and/or subversive gestures of Duchamp and Dada, Warhol and Pop Art, to the satire of gender roles and modern capitalism in Postmodernism. We will pay particular attention to the role of satire in modern art as it employed irony, parody, ridicule and exaggeration to attack social mores, political figures and the art world status quo. We will also explore the use of satire in film and TV, from the darkly comic (Charlie Chaplin) to the ridiculous (Stephen Colbert). This course hopes to come to terms with the broad range and appeal of satire in the visual arts.",,ART; WCult:W,

Students will develop a toolkit for analyzing the way borders shape culture and identity (race, gender, sexuality, class, religion, and ethnicity) in transnational points of contact. With an emphasis on printmaking, performance, photography, and film, the course will dwell on borders that respond to paradigms of fear and desire, contagion and containment, utopia and dystopia.

ARTH,48.07,Michelangelo’s Modernism,,,"In 1837 Eugène Delacroix named Michelangelo Buonarroti the “father of modern art.”  What led the great 19th century Romantic painter and critic to identify the Florentine sculptor, painter, architect, and poet as the origin of the modern school? Declared “divine,” during his lifetime, he has been celebrated as the non plus ultra of artistic genius, or vilified as the very epitome of artistic excess ever since. Enthusiasts and detractors alike have viewed Michelangelo as the model of the self-conscious artist. This course will trace ‘il divino’s’ role in the formation of the cult of the modern artist through examining artworks and texts ranging from the artist’s lifetime and afterlife in art, literature, and film. Beginning with the construction of Michelangelo’s persona by early biographers, we will consider why he came to embody the tension between the demands of tradition and innovation like no other artist. Each week we will closely investigate artworks in dialogue with primary sources in English translation. Secondary texts selected from the superb scholarly literature on Michelangelo and his afterlife will be used to supplement primary materials. Throughout the course we will consider the idea of Michelangelo and the Michelangesque functioned through five centuries of cultural production.",,ART; WCult:W,

The selfie and Instagram are but two of the most recent ways in which photographic technology has become ubiquitous in our everyday lives. This course traces the evolution of the photograph from pre-photographic forms, such as the diorama to its current digital apotheosis. We will focus on how the medium evolved in concert with changing social conditions that shaped, and were shaped in turn, by its evolution. A wide range of practices will be considered, from documentary photographs to fine art. Major figures in photo history will be discussed alongside developments in photographic technology and their impact on photographic imagery in both fine art and visual culture more broadly (advertising, science, journalism). Throughout we will explore photography as a ‘thick’ medium, one inextricably bound up with social and theoretical concerns. Students will exit having a broad knowledge of the historical benchmarks and aesthetic theories of photography, as well as the ability to describe and analyze images in light of photographic technique.",,ART; WCult:W,

During this time, the Italian peninsula was a hotbed of revolutionary ideas about how architecture could shape and be shaped by the human will. The Renaissance saw the emergence of a new type of architecture, which took its cue from the needs, activities, and aspirations of people who defined themselves as “modern.” The chronologically presented material is interspersed with classes dedicated to the broad themes of the course (humanism, the inspirational role of ancient and medieval buildings, living conditions and styles, the rising profession of the architect, etc.).

We will study major works by each artist through in-class discussion as well as by placing different scholarly interpretations in dialog. Students will learn how to visually analyze and interpret mural art. In addition to considering muralism and its relationship to the Mexican Revolution and the post-revolutionary reconstruction of the state and society, we will also consider class and the politics of labor, gender and the politics of the body, sexual identity and the politics of desire, and race and the politics of nationalism in Mexico and the United States in from the 1920s and 30s through the 1960s. The course places special emphasis on José Clemente Orozco’s Epic of American Civilization through term-long student research projects as well as an exploration of the historical reception of the mural over time.

At the same time, this course will also offer students a critical framework for analyzing the display, marketing and consumption of artworks in a global economy.",,ART,
ARTH,63.72,Aesthetics of the Digital,Elias,,"This course confronts one of the most urgent and elusive problems of our day: the relationship of aesthetics to the rise of digital media. Drawing on a range of critical texts and artistic practices, we will consider how fundamental aesthetic categories such as materiality and form are transformed through the radical shift from a work-oriented to a medium-oriented conception of art and reality. In broader terms, this module explores the rapidly mutable audio-visual environments/interfaces of the digital age and their impact on social relations and cultural production. We will also examine the tensions between intimacy and distance, distraction and attention, and passivity and participation that characterize image consumption within the routines of contemporary technological culture. Finally, this module offers a historical and political framework for understanding contemporary art’s seeming disavowal of the digital and the expanding non-stop processes of twenty-first-century capitalism that underpin it. At the same time, we will assess some of emancipatory possibilities opened by the accessibility and affordability of digital cameras, editing software and mobile devices. As well as making use of the interpretive methods of art history, this module will introduce students to tools drawn from social semiotics, media studies, anthropology, visual culture, cybernetics and design philosophy.",,INT or ART,
ARTH,63.73,Art in the Age of Climate Change,Elias,,"Since the advent of industrial capitalism, humans have released 555 petagrams of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, increasing CO2 concentrations to a level not seen for at least 800,000 years. The long-term consequences of these atmospheric changes remain unknown, but there is already strong evidence that the Earth is rapidly moving into a less biologically diverse, less forested, much warmer, and probably wetter and stormier state. Research on climate change points to a particular irony: human actions have unprecedented impact on the environment, but this produces effects that are increasingly out of human control. Inside that conundrum lies another. Scientists have certain strategies to address urgent environmental challenges, but what of the arts and the humanities? What can practitioners in these fields, in dialogue with the sciences, offer in this moment of climatic disruption and political inaction? To what new modes of visualization does global warming give rise, and how do these aesthetic innovations allow us to live with and through environmental change? What ontological status can be assigned to various biological, geological, and meteorological ‘actors’ if human agency is no longer privileged?",,ART; WCult:W,
ARTH,80.01,Ideals of Physical Beauty: Gender and the Body in Ancient Art,Cohen,,"Since the foundation of Art History as a discipline, Greek art has been admired for its emphasis on physical beauty. Greek culture articulated criteria of beauty for both sexes and created mythological personas exemplifying those ideals. This seminar studies Greek views on beauty and ugliness, as well as the links between beauty and (im)morality. It focuses on how artists went about depicting physicality and explores the connection between perceived beauty and pictorial style, often in comparison with other Mediterranean cultures. Contemporary critical frameworks and theoretical approaches to gender and representation will guide class discussions.",,ART; WCult:W,
ARTH,80.02,Advanced Seminar: Domes,Camerlenghi,,"Domes have graced the skyline of human settlements for over three millennia. The seminar commences with a traditional typological survey of domes, progresses to explore the theoretical foundations that informed their construction, and concludes by examining the social, cultural, and religious factors favoring (or discouraging) their development and proliferation. We will focus especially, but not uniquely, on ancient and medieval domes. Historically, domes have covered a range of buildings: from kilns to tombs, from bell-towers to latrines; however, they most famously crowned places of worship, burial or power. We will ponder: What is a dome? Which qualities define their identities? How and why has the knowledge of dome construction been transferred across time and cultures? What are important methodological considerations to consider as we approach the study of domes?",,ART; WCult:W,

We will examine Confucian phisophy and how Confucian ideas shaped the social hierarchy, gender roles, and aesthetic values through exploration of the architecture of royal palaces and aristocratic houses, paintngs both sacred and secular, ceramics, textiles and other crafts. Use of colors, symbolic motifs, and stories in the arts and cultures will be investigated.

Consideration is also given to the diffusion of photographic images into other media including news publications, government documents, academic studies, travelogues, guidebooks, and museum displays.",,,
ARTH,83.02,"Contemporary Art: Disaster, War and the Ethics of Witnessing",,,"This seminar focuses on the relationship between lens-based media and moments of catastrophe in order to think creatively about how both operate pictorally. What constitutes the category of catastrophe—as opposed to crisis, war, etc.—and how does that category structure but also exceed photographic representation? We will look at photographs and films that bear witness to massacres, genocides and terrorist attacks. Some of the case studies include Auschwitz, Hiroshima, Apartheid South Africa, the Vietnam War, the Palestinian Nakba, the Cambodian Genocide and the Lebanese Civil War. We will also look at the role images play in documenting more recent events such as the Gulf War, the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York, the 2011 earthquake in Fukushima, the Syrian Civil War and the European migrant crisis. Readings will take us through photographic history, critical theory, and art history. Our study will conclude in considering how artist themselves have theorized the place and purpose of photography and film in historical catastrophes.\\\\u2028Underlying the arc of our study are three interrelated categories of questions. These concern: 1) the relationship of aesthetics to ethics and politics; 2) the relationship of those models of visuality and visibility to subaltern ways of understanding history 3) the ways in which art relates to questions of alterity and agency, which is to say how art might speak to without speaking for the victims of catastrophy.",,ART,

ARTH,83.05,Advanced Seminar: Art and the Law,,,"This Advanced Seminar addresses legal issues that pertain to the sale, acquisition, display, ownership, and destruction of works of art. The topic is framed around two related questions: How does the special status of art, as a privileged sphere of creative expression, grant it different treatment under the law? What are some of the exemptions, protections, or obligations that are accorded to art that are not extended to other forms of personal property? The first part of the course will focus on case studies in which legal questions are entangled with ethical and political concerns: illicit international trade in looted art, repatriation claims, high-profile forgeries, and new guidelines for authentication. The second half looks at the legal framework that governs artists’ rights (including resale royalties, copyright, and freedom of expression) as well as the rules that structure transactions in the primary (e.g. artist-dealer contracts and handshake agreements) and secondary art markets. We will also analyze problems related to the representation of artists’ estates, the acquisition and de-accessioning of artworks by museums, and the tax codes associated with charitable contributions of works of art. Finally, the class considers how artists strategically make use of the unique affordances of the law and test what it is that artworks can do outside the circumscribed domain of the art world.",,ART,

The second theme, the Porcelain stories, conveys how aesthetics, technology, designs and motifs were transmitted from East to West and vice versa. We will ask questions, such as: Why was porcelain so desirable? Where did porcelain rank in the hierarchy of art forms and materials in Asia and Europe? How much did a piece of porcelain cost at any moment in time? Why did Japan and Korea have “the Pottery War” and what was the significance of that war in East Asia (and Europe)? The third theme, the Jesuits and the Arts, looks at the hybrid blend of two or more traditions and the artistic productions that arose from those blends. We also will examine together the paintings of Asian and European artists, the paintings of European artists on Asian themes with a traditional Asian medium, and the work of Asian painters’ on European subject matter with a European medium.

In fact, the very question of “what is a gene?” is even being reconsidered, as the fundamental unit of genomic organization appears not to be the classical DNA-based “gene” but instead is the RNA-based transcript.  In this course we will explore these issues and more through lectures, literature discussions, student-led presentations, and student writing assignments. ","One from among BIOL 40, BIOL 41, BIOL 43, BIOL 45, BIOL 47 or CHEM 41",SCI,

Vergil’s famous phrase “love conquers all” (omnia uincit amor, Eclogues 10.69) encapsulates the centrality of amor to the poetic genre of elegy. But the notion of love as a conquering force also hints at its ability to overwhelm, subdue, and destroy. The idea of love, broadly conceived, is embedded in the literature, philosophy, scientific thought, religion, and art and archaeology of the Romans. We will explore love in its various forms – devotion, lust, physical sexuality, friendship, and familial bonds – by looking at the central authors and genres of the Latin literary tradition (in English translation).

CLST,10.09,Quantitative Literary Criticism,,QSS 30.12,"Digitization of vast numbers of texts and rapid advances in computational methods are enabling new forms of criticism in all areas of literary study. Classics was an early adopter of digital technologies, and computation is now pervasive throughout the field, as illustrated by flagship projects such as the Perseus Digital Library. Beyond the familiar examples of digitized texts and simple word searches, scholars and students also benefit from an ever-growing array of sophisticated quantitative tools, and from increasing engagement with diverse technical disciplines – natural language processing, data science, even bioinformatics. Through a survey of recent research at the intersection of Latin literature and the digital humanities, this course will introduce you to the state of the art in quantitative literary criticism. To ground our methodological investigations, we will explore a diverse selection of Latin poetry, including epic (Vergil, Lucan, and Catullus), elegy (Catullus), and comedy (Plautus), and sample some less famous later authors, such as Paul the Deacon and Vitalis of Blois, who were influenced by classical antecedents. At each turn, we will examine the interplay between traditional (close reading, philology, theory) and data-driven analyses of Latin literature and consider how quantitative methods can support humanistic inquiry. Along the way, you will gain hands-on experience with powerful computational tools and be introduced to now ubiquitous critical approaches, such as intertextuality and reception studies.

In this investigation, we will encounter many questions with which we are still grappling today, such as: What constitutes scientific thinking? How do science and cultural context determine and reflect one another? What is human nature? Is a disease a moral failing? How do we understand gender and sex in medical terms? All readings will be in translation, and no prior knowledge of medicine or Greco-Roman antiquity is necessary.",,TMV; WCult:W,
CLST,10.11,Plato's Protagoras,,,"We will read one of Plato’s most celebrated dialogues, in which Socrates meets the most famous intellectuals of the day.  The dialogue is rich in philosophical content as it focuses on the question of what excellence is, whether it can be taught, and the role of education in a young person’s life.  Students do not need to know ancient Greek or have any previous knowledge of Plato to take this course.",,TMV; WCult:W,
CLST,10.12,The End of the World: Jewish and Christian Apocalyptic Literature in the Hellenistic Era,,,"The Hellenistic era was a period of remarkable theological and literary creativity within the Jewish and Christian communities, including the development of a unique genre, apocalyptic literature. Apocalyptic texts, which portend a catastrophic end to the world, are notoriously difficult to interpret due to their use of fantastical imagery and often cryptic symbolism.  In this class we will explore several texts in depth, including portions of Daniel from the Hebrew scriptures, the Book of Enoch from the Maccabean period, the Apocalypse of John (Revelation) from the Christian scriptures, and the 2nd century Christian text Apocalypse of Peter. In addition to learning how to read apocalyptic literature, we will examine the socio-historical context of these texts, their relationship to communities under duress and how they have been reimagined by later generations.",,TMV; WCult:W,

Sparta conquered much of the southern Peloponnese and became a militarized society with an economy based almost entirely on agriculture. Corinth’s territory was, compared to that of Sparta, minuscule, but it became a powerful and wealthy community through the foundation of numerous colonies and commerce. Sparta was famed for its army, Corinth for its navy. Spartans were known for the simplicity of their lifestyle and the architectural simplicity of their city, whereas Corinthians overtly enjoyed luxuries and erected some of the Greeks’ earliest large-scale stone temples.

CLST,11.07,Slave Societies Ancient and Modern: Imperial Rome and Brazil,,LACS 30.10,"Although slavery has existed in virtually all cultures, scholars of comparative world slavery have identified only five societies in all of human history as ""slave societies"": two were in the ancient world (classical Athens, Rome) and three were in the New World (the American South, the Caribbean, Brazil). This course examines slave systems in the ancient and modern worlds comparatively, focusing on Rome and Brazil. In Rome, the emergence of the state, including the development of the concept of the citizen, coincided with the development of the slave society. African slavery in Brazil was introduced soon after the establishment of the colonial government and drew heavily from classical legal definitions. In this course we compare the social and political structures of these two slave systems (high art, popular culture, institutions). We examine how each slave society was legitimated, perpetuated-and ultimately challenged. Specific topics include: the construction of the slave and the emergence of racializing discourse, the slave trade and the commodification of the body, trickster narratives, modern theories of power and domination, resistance and rebellion, and the problem of freedom for previously dominated peoples. Through comparison, students will not only become aware of the similarities between these two slave societies, but will also be better equipped to evaluate their unique qualities and particular achievements.",,INT or LIT; WCult:NW,

Both men—as well as many others involved in the case--came from local towns in Roman Italy. The stakes for conviction: loss of civic status, essentially a social death. Cicero’s defense of his client provides a masterly example of courtroom defense strategies (the mustering of evidence, witness testimony, manipulation of legal procedures) and the courtroom story-telling that created presumptive realities of “wrong” and “truth,” of “innocence” or ”guilt.”  The speech thus affords insight into questions of Roman courtroom procedure and judicial integrity, of the assimilation of Italians within the Roman social and political community and access to Roman law, and of the social expectations",,LIT; WCult:W,

Painters make work out of color, and develop a subtle understanding of what color is by mixing and juxtaposing pigments. This course introduces students to the problems of color from both the painter’s and the philosopher’s perspective. Students will gain familiarity with philosophical theories of color as well as theories of color sourced in painting. They will develop the ability to work with paint and chromatic light so as to bring about different effects.

Given this blindness, it comes as no surprise that we would be living in times that do not pay enough attention to the humanities or to the aesthetic realm for they seem too ""removed"" from the day to day facts of ""reality."" But let's think again. Who bears witness to the suffering and inequalities around us, to the walls that have been relentlessly erected to keep us all in place?

But there are a number of countries around the world whose economic organization is NOT mainly guided by markets; some of these economies remain partially controlled, or planned, where property and the means of production are formally government-owned and prices are centrally determined. This history of central planning has influenced the development of markets in much of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union; some economies have fully transitioned from planning to markets, while some lag significantly behind. In this class, students will study the history of the centrally-planned economic system and how it influenced economic development in Poland and we learn how Poland’s economy has transitioned to a market-oriented economy.",ECON 1,,

In this course, we will examine noir in relation to its many contexts: the hard-boiled fiction of Chandler and Hammett; the experience of dislocation and alienation that reflect the exile status of many central-European professionals who worked in the US film industry in the 1940s; and Hollywood blacklisting and censorship during the anti-Communist witch hunt. The course will also trace the pervasive presence of noir and its continuing appeal for artists and audiences throughout the world. Because of its artistic and political complexity, noir is a key term for the study of US postwar cultural history: noir narratives revolve around questions of racial and national identity, around the postwar crisis of masculinity, and the convergence of modernism and mass culture.",,INT or ART; WCult:W,

FILM,41.14,The Western,M. Willilams,,"Explores the development of the Western genre from its beginnings in pre-cinematic culture and silent cinema through its maturation in the Classical Hollywood era (1930s to 1950s), its path toward revisionism in the 1960s and 1970s, and its fluttering obsolescence ever since. Historical analysis of this most prolific, and most ""American,"" of Hollywood genres provides a singularly nation-centered perspective on changing U.S. culture, ideologies, and sensibilities.",,ART; WCult:W,
FILM,41.15,20th-Century American Film Comedy,J. Rapf,,"Though tragedy is a more respected genre, comedy emanates from the same source: the recognition of a gap between what is, and what ought to be.

FILM,41.16,Space and Genre,D. Garcia,,"This course explores representations of space and place in Hollywood genres. We will examine the musical, the melodrama, and film noir to discern how space informs and complicates their conventions; discuss how cinematic representation of specific spaces (the apartment, the city, the hotel) blurs genre boundaries; and consider how race, gender, and sexuality influence cinematic representations of spaces. Students will produce their own video essays to intervene in current scholarly debates on cinema, genre, and spatial representation.",,ART; WCult:W,

Through viewing films, listening to sounds, and studying works of art spanning painting, sculpture, installation, site-specific practice, and performance, we will inspire and provide critical/historical contexts for your personal work in the course.",,ART,
FILM,41.18,Latinx-ploitation,,LACS 24.50,"This course serves as an introduction to the history of Latinx cinema, Latinx film spectatorship, and exploitation cinema in the United States. Latinx audiences have long been an interest and target of the Hollywood studios. Since the beginning of sound in film, the studios grappled with reaching this linguistically and culturally-diverse demographic. Since the late 20th century, the studios have widely acknowledged the box office power of that group. Time and again, however, the Hollywood industry has failed to accurately identify and engage Latinx peoples on both sides of the US-Mexico border. Applying theories of racialized spectatorship and performance and film genre and authorship, we will interrogate this historically troubled relationship and grapple with its consequences for Latinx representation and inclusion in American cinema.  \f\\f

FILM,41.19,The Musical,D. Garcia,,"This course introduces students to the history and evolution of the musical film. From the beginnings of sound cinema, the musical has entertained diverse audiences. While its popularity has at times waned, the musical continues to appear on 21st century movie screens. What accounts for the musical’s popularity in different moments in the past? What have been its central themes and cultural preoccupations? How have filmmakers developed a cinematic language in order to lend musicals expression? And what kinds of theoretical paradigms have scholars employed in order to better understand the genre’s evolution?",,ART; WCult:W,
FILM,41.20,Special Effects in Film History,P. Young,,"“Special visual effects” has many meanings in cinema. When we use the term in the twenty-first century, we usually refer to computer-generated fantasy images of otherworldly creatures or impossible locales. However, the history of special visual effects begins with the basic technologies of photographically filmed moving pictures, and effects—whether matte shots using optical printers in post-production, rear- or front-projection process shots done live on-set, in-camera mattes and mirror shots, or “creature” effects controlled by wires, puppetry, robotics, or remotes—have served many purposes besides generating fantasy worlds. Beginning in the 1890s, the magician and filmmaker Georges Melies used editing, photographic processes, elaborate puppets, and ornate costumes and sets to take viewers up to the moon or down to the bottom of the sea. Only two decades later, however, processes similar to those utilized by Melies were primarily employed to film realistic-looking settings at a fraction of the cost of location shooting. Today, scholars of special visual effects try to answer historical as well as technical questions about what has motivated the incredible innovations of “FX,” the forms they take, and the functions they perform for producers and viewers. What determines these different uses of special effects? How have these processes and practices developed in the US film industry and among independent creators? And how do the standards of realism and plausibility—the standards by which special effects are traditionally judged—change depending on the era, the technologies being employed, and the culture in and for which films are made? This course will place us in the thick of such contemporary scholarly debates about special effects and their history. By viewing key examples of special effects cinema from the past century (primarily from US films) and reading what historians have argued about the significance of these films, students will learn to write and think in these terms and to develop their own educated stances on the topic—to participate as full partners in these scholarly debates. Students will also learn to consider such conditions as industrial history and cultural change as factors in the development of special effects as well as what these effects mean to their viewers.",,ART,

FILM,42.08,Asian Animation as Socio-Political Artifact,,AMES 40.04,"Because animated films have traditionally been targeted at children, animators in Asia have often been able to side-step much of the political control exercised by some of their more centralized governments to create sophisticated artistic works that speak as much to educated adults as they do to children. The course will feature the most interesting of these works from China, Japan, and Korea, and students will analyze them within a socio-political and cultural context. Particular attention will be paid to the development of both originality and argumentation in student papers and class participation.",,ART; WCult:NW,
FILM,42.09,African Cinema,A. Coly,AAAS 55.01,"This course focuses on the cinemas of Francophone Africa. We will examine early Western filmic representations of Africans as savages devoid of culture and history. We will then examine how African filmmakers have challenged those images by creating new depictions of their societies, offering Africa through African eyes. We will explore the social, historical, and political contexts of these films and explore their aesthetic and narrative characteristics. We will discuss issues and theories related to the definition of the so-called third world cinema, postcolonial cinema, and postmodern cinema.",,ART; WCult:NW,
FILM,42.13,Global Documentary and Transnational Cinema,M. Roberts,,"Since the Lumière Brothers first began dispatching camera operators around the world to shoot actualité films over a century ago, documentary film and video have played a major historical role in constructing and mediating popular understandings of the global.

FILM,42.14,Mexican Cinema,D. Garcia,LACS 024,"This course serves as an introduction to Mexican cinema and the global system of filmmaking in which it developed. We will examine the history of Mexican film, filmmaking practices, aesthetics and business concerns, as well as audiences inside and outside of Mexico. One central point of inquiry will be the extent to which Mexican cinema was truly ""national."" We will question the concept of “national cinema” all the while analyzing the extent to which issues in Mexican politics, society, and culture were reflected on and influenced by the screen. The transnationality of Mexican film will be central to our investigation as we examine the influence of the United States and Hollywood during Mexican cinema’s development. Students will learn about the various styles and genres of Mexican film and the theories with which film scholars have interpreted them. Among the filmmakers to be studied are Sergei Eisenstein, Fernando de Fuentes, Emilio “El Indio” Fernandez, Luis Buñuel, Alfonso Arau, Maria Novaro, Natalia Almada, Guillermo del Toro, Alfonso Cuarón, and Alejandro Gonzales-Iñárritu.

Drawing on a wide variety of resources in English translation—from Russian films and novels to YouTube videos and social media posts—you will navigate the diverse technologies and media products that are helping to shape contemporary Russian identity. You will explore, for example, the ‘violent entrepreneurship’ of oil oligarchs, the cynicism of state-funded television propagandists, and the avant-garde theatrics of Moscow’s feminist dissidents. Your study of Putin’s Russia should also allow us to discuss some of the most pressing questions facing citizens in a democracy today: What is the nature of truth in the digital age? How do content creators and media consumers determine what is credible? What factors and forces are shaping the messages we consume through our televisions, tablets, and smartphones, and how can we learn to critically evaluate these messages in order to lead better lives?",,LIT; WCult:W,

FILM,42.19,The Middle East in Film: Picturing the Past and Present,,JWST 44.01 MES 15.11,"How may films serve as a starting point for revisiting the past and rethinking the present? In what ways may representations of the Middle East differ over time and across places? And why do the stories told by filmmakers in documentaries, historical dramas, and other cinematic productions matter? Movies depicting the Middle East routinely draw mass audiences and consequently shape popular perceptions of the region the world over. The very same films, however, are all too often understood by many people as mere entertainment. In this class, we will consider what movies, if treated critically, may teach us about Middle East history. Beginning with a brief introduction to film and media studies, we will contemplate where the Middle East fits into this field of inquiry. Once establishing how we will approach movies and the Middle East throughout the term, we will navigate a number of key themes together, from war, memory, and migration to (mis)information, revolution, and representation. Along the way, we will watch everything from indie films to big budget blockbusters. Regardless of the exact form these projects assume, all of the pictures we explore will generate debate and discussion around the past and present. Among the topics we will cover are the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, European colonialism, and America’s legacy in the Arab world. To assist us on this journey across the Middle East and well beyond its boundaries, we will engage several primary sources, with motion pictures at the forefront. These thought-provoking items will empower us to partake in conversations that traverse languages, national borders, historical eras, and artistic genres, enabling us to view the Middle East in an entirely new way.",,ART; WCult:NW,

The City of Light is arguably one of the most beautiful and exciting destinations in the world. However, all that glitters is not gold. Matters of race and anti-blackness co-exist with a variety of myths, narratives, and representations of Paris and France as color-blind and race-free.

This course will pursue a perhaps inadvertent insight made during the trials against these two core figures in French – and world – literature: namely, that the so-called crimes (of shocking moral corruption, of prurience and obscenity, etc.) of which Baudelaire and Flaubert were accused have much to do with the formal complexity and aporias that one finds in their works. What one finds there, in other words, is less “filthy” material per se than a stylistics that opens up space for dangerously unruly sociocritical readings; that brings into visibility and legibility desires and subjectivities typically confined in the nineteenth century to the grisaille silencieuse of “History’s” margins; and that seeks to bring out into representation repressed historical and political traumas occasioned by the “shocks” of modernity (Benjamin). One finds, in other words, in Baudelaire’s poetry and in Flaubert’s novels a distinct literary politics; a critical use of literature against the abuses of the present order of things.

Situating Dante in his own time and place will be essential to our analysis of his poetry, but attention to the multiple ways that Dante’s work has been interpreted, translated, and appropriated in other periods, languages, and media will provide a critical framework for understanding its enduring appeal, why – in the words of Italo Calvino – it “has not finished saying what it has to say.” Readings, lectures, discussion, and written work – to include a mid-term exam, two short essays, and a final digital project – will be in English.

The unprecedented fusion Dante made of these elements in the Commedia [The Divine Comedy] has guaranteed his great poem a vast public, extending across world cultures and the seven centuries since it initially traveled among elite readers in north-central Italy in the early decades of the fourteenth century. This course will first examine the development of Dante’s poetic voice in La vita nova [The New Life, ca. 1293-94] and then focus on its subsequent expansion into an all-encompassing vision of life and death in Inferno [Hell, ca. 1306-09], the first of the three canticles of the Commedia. Situating Dante in his own time and place will be essential to our analysis of his poetry, but attention to the multiple ways that Dante’s work has been interpreted, translated, and appropriated in other periods, languages, and media will provide a critical framework for understanding its enduring appeal, why – in the words of Italo Calvino – it “has not finished saying what it has to say.” Readings, lectures, discussion, and written work – to include a mid-term exam, two short essays, and a final digital project – will be in English.

When did it become possible to turn adventures into a business or entertainment? What is an adventure to begin with? Can it be described as a form? These questions themselves show just how wide a net we have to cast if we are to apprehend something of what constitutes adventures and adventurers. This question needs to be considered in the terms of literary, cultural, and media history. With regard to adventurers (both male and female), a highly interesting question to examine is whether they consciously expose themselves to danger in order to experience an adventure or whether the adventure is the inadvertent consequence of fate or accident. The character and significance of these questions changes as they approach the present, in which the pursuit of adventure is becoming ever more widespread and its documentation includes real-time transmission almost as a matter of course.

I grew up in a village close to the Alps, which provided me with multiple occasions to learn to hate them (alternatively: read them, see them, wonder) which seems a fair starting point for our adventurous climbs through the hilly landscape of German fiction and poetry. We will be dealing with trips to mountains and the insights, visions and pitfalls they provide us with. Our guiding questions will be: is there any such thing as “nature writing” in German? If yes: how and why does it differ from the Anglo-American tradition? How is it possible to translate any-“thing” critterly (picking up a term used by Donna Haraway) into language? And which kind of language would we like to use – rather: need to invent – in order to do so?",,LIT; WCult:W,

HIST,1,Turning Points in American History,Bonner. Butler,,"Students in this course will analyze and evaluate a very select number of ""pivotal moments"" over the past four centuries of American history. As an introduction to historical thinking and argumentation, the course will combine close scrutiny of documents from the past with an awareness of interpretive issues of contingency, determinism, and historical agency raised by leading contemporary historians.",,SOC; WCult:W,
HIST,2,#EverythingHasAHistory: Understanding America Today,,,"This introductory course will explore the historical roots of current events in the United States.  This course demonstrates how history is woven into the fabric of our everyday lives and why understanding history is important for understanding the present and navigating the future.  We will focus on case studies—such as immigration and borders, computers and society, and race and whiteness—and expect the syllabus to evolve in real time depending on what is in the news during the quarter.  This class serves as an introductory course for History majors, but is open to all students.",,SOC; WCult:W,
HIST,3.01,Europe in the Age of Wonder,Gaposchkin and Simons,,"This course examines Europe from the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century through religious warfare in the 17th century, when society, economics, politics, and culture were guided by a sense of wonder, which held people in awe of their rulers and the divine. Wonder did not imply passivity: from the disintegration of the Roman Empire to the emergence of early nation states, through crusades, the expansion of trade, religious reformation, and advances in scientific thinking. Europeans drew on their experiences to develop new concepts of representative government, individual liberty, and religious meaning.",,SOC; WCult:W,
HIST,3.02,Europe in the Age of Discovery,,,"This course introduces students to an age of discovery during which Europeans encountered worlds, real and imagined, far beyond the realm of the familiar. Between the latter half of the 14th century through the late 18th century European society, economics, politics, ideas, and culture were altered in ways that increasingly took on aspects of modernity. From the aftermath of a pandemic crisis through a period punctuated by religious reformations, civil wars, and revolutionary regicides, Europeans steadily adopted more modern attitudes to property, authority, community, work, family, the body, nature, and supernatural forces.",,SOC; WCult:W,
HIST,3.03,Europe in the Age of Violence,"Greenberg, Petruccelli",,"The last two centuries were an era of dramatic transformations and contradictions: while Europeans enjoyed unprecedented prosperity, technological advances, and social mobility, they also unleashed and experienced empire, terror, total war, foreign occupations, and mass murder. Throughout these 100 years, contrasting visions of a new society ushered in a range of different regimes—monarchical empires, liberal republics, murderous and racist dictatorships, Communist autocracies, and a democratic welfare states—yet these visions also led to the emancipation of women, the development of a new consumer society, the creation of environmentalist movements and new counter-cultures, and the transformation of everyday lives.",,SOC; WCult:W,
HIST,4.01,The Crusades,"Briggs, Gaposchkin",,"The crusades, launched by European Christians who sought to secure military control over the Holy Land, led to a period of sustained and largely inimical contact between Christian and Muslim cultures. Covering the period from 1095-ca.1350, this course explores the cultural, religious, and ideological contexts of crusade history which shaped notions of religious violence, holy war, and ethnic cleansing, along with a long history of distrust between the peoples of Christian Europe (or the Christian West) and the Islamic Middle East.",,DIST:INT or SOC; WCult: CI,
HIST,4.02,Introduction to the History of the Islamic Middle East,,,"This course is a survey of the histories and cultures of the Islamic Middle East, starting in the era before the advent of Islam in the 7th century until the eve of the 20th century. This class will begin with the regional and global contexts in which Islam emerged, examining the history of the Prophet Muhammad, the Qur’anic revelation, and the first community of believers. We will then look at the expansion of the “abode of Islam” over the course of several centuries, asking why so many people in so many different regions converted to Islam. We will also study philosophical, cultural, legal, political, and social trends in region now known as the Middle East and North Africa until the era of early European colonialism.",,INT or SOC; WCult:NW,
HIST,4.03,Introduction to the Modern Middle East and North Africa,"Simon, Nikpour",MES 02.03,"The diverse nations and peoples that make up the Middle East and North Africa are of major significance in our contemporary world, at the same time that they are often misunderstood or given only superficial (albeit spectacular) popular attention. This lecture course is designed to give students a nuanced introductory overview of the modern histories of this region. Students will read a variety of primary and secondary materials designed to familiarize them with the historical, cultural, and social processes that have affected and transformed the region in question, and will learn to put these regional histories in a global framework. The course begins with a brief summary of the early modern Islamicate “Gunpowder” Empires—Mughal, Safavid/Qajar, Ottoman—and then moves through several topics of significance: the era of European colonialism; the establishment of the nation state; competing discourses of nationalism; the emergence of Third Worldist and anti-colonial movements; the Israeli- Palestinian conflict; debates over the politics of gender; the effects of the Cold War; the processes of decolonization and the establishment of post-colonial states; the rise of revolutionary Islamism; oil politics and policies; globalization and neoliberalism; 9/11, terrorism, and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; the Arab uprisings of 2010-2011; and the region’s uncertain present and future.",,SOC; WCult:NW,
HIST,5.01,Pre-Colonial African History,Sackeyfio-Lenoch,AAAS 14,"This course will examine the social and economic history of Africa to 1800. Several interrelated themes of social organization, the expansion of trade, rise of new social classes, the emergence and disintegration of various states and European intervention will be discussed.

HIST,5.03,The History of China since 1800,Cheng,ASCL 64.08,"This survey course traces China's social, political, and cultural development from the relative peace and prosperity of the high Qing period, through the devastating wars and imperialist incursions of the nineteenth century, to the efforts, both vain and fruitful, to build an independent and powerful new nation.

HIST,5.04,Introduction to Korean Culture,Suh and Lim,ASCL 10.02,"This course provides an introduction to Korean culture and history, examining Korea's visual and textual expressions from the pre-modern age to the twentieth century. What are the origins of Korean national and cultural identities? How have Korean claims of cultural distinctiveness been manifested and modified over time? Tracing answers to these questions simultaneously helps us to consider how and why Korea has entered America's consciousness. As Korea matters to the US not simply as a fact but as a project, this course avoids portraying Korea through any generalized statements or uncritical categories. Rather, students are encouraged to explore novel perspectives on Korea and thereby unravel their own prejudices and agendas. No prior acquaintance with the Korean language is required.",,SOC; WCult:CI,

HIST,5.13,Modern Latin America,Meléndez-Badillo,LACS 01.10,"This course presents the histories of Latin American and Caribbean societies, peoples, and nations from the onset of the Haitian Revolution in 1791 to the present. By placing Haiti at the center of the Age of Revolutions, this course also locates the Caribbean region within the Latin American context. We will study the region’s nation-building processes using an intersectional lens to explore how different people interpreted them through their own gendered, classed, and racialized identities.",,SOC; WCult:NW,
HIST,5.14,The Americas from Invasion to Independence,,,"Rather than following a narrative across three centuries, this course will use a thematic approach to explore how European empires were conceived, built, and challenged in the Americas. We will discuss how Europeans conceptualized their power, what they hoped they might get out of it, and how they sought to manage people and trade once they had established flourishing businesses and societies. Were their motives economic, religious, or political? Were they responding primarily to events in Europe, or were colonists and officials merely adapting pragmatically to the new environments and people they encountered? Crucially, we will also consider the imposition of empire from the perspectives of the ordinary people who negotiated it on the ground – Native Americans, European colonists, sailors, merchants, and the enslaved. How did they exploit or reject the grander schemes of their aspiring rulers? Finally, we will consider what legacies this complex imperial past has left for contemporary societies across the hemisphere.

We will begin by considering divergent conceptions of the body in Chinese and Greek antiquity before moving on to the transformation of the healing traditions and the advance of modern biomedicine since 1800. Instead of imposing ""holism"" or ""reductionism"" on medical traditions, this course encourages students to view past expressions of medicine as a means of analyzing our own self here and now.",,INT or SOC; WCult:NW,

HIST,8.04,History of Sexuality in America,Moreton,WGSS 26.03,"How have historical processes produced distinct sexual practices and identities over time? This course engages 300 years of a history that often evaded the historical record or was deliberately purged from it and asks how more traditional topics of U.S. historical inquiry—immigration, citizenship, economic organization, intellectual and artistic production, racialization, formal politics, law, religious practice—can yield new insights when sexual history is included as a legitimate dimension of analysis.",,SOC; WCult:W,

HIST,8.08,Horse History,Crossley,,"The use of the horse in war and transport coincides with the emergence of written history, and the end of the use of the horse in war and transport coincides with the transition to the age of nuclear weapons and electronic communications. In between, the horse has been essential to global processes of agricultural and industrial development, urbanization, exploration and conquest.

Oral history interviews are collaborations between interviewers and narrators (interviewees). Such interviews are used to explore both the lives of individuals and the histories of communities. In some cases, oral history provides a way to access voices and perspectives that are marginalized or absent from the materials contained in conventional archives. The use of oral history interviews as primary sources raises complex questions about narrative, subjectivity, memory, and historical truth. In this course, students will be trained to conduct an interview for the Dartmouth Vietnam Project, an ongoing oral history project that records testimony from community members about their memories of the Vietnam War and its impact on their lives.",,INT or SOC,
HIST,10.04,Dartmouth Black Lives,Rabig and Winston,AAAS 20.01,"This course equips students with research methods, critical frameworks, and interview skills to document the lives of Black alumni and contribute to an archive of oral sources on Black history at Dartmouth.

HIST,82.01,The Politics of Natural Disaster in Latin America,Meléndez-Badillo.,LACS 031,"In September 2017 two massive hurricanes, Irma and María, swept the Caribbean. As a result, Barbuda was left uninhabitable, Puerto Rico’s unofficial death toll was estimated in the thousands, and Dominica resembled a war zone. Hundreds of thousands were left without electricity and potable water in a region that was already suffering from stagnating economies and humanitarian crises. These natural events and their unnatural consequences laid bare the region’s legacy of colonialism, underdevelopment, and failing infrastructures. Things will never go back to the way they were before. Yet, these events are hardly unique in the Caribbean and Latin American experience.
\fLatin America, and the Caribbean region within it, have not only been shaped by human development but also by natural events. Hurricanes and earthquakes—the two natural events this course focuses on—have transformed the region’s landscape. This course seeks to answer the question of what can the history of natural disasters teach us about political structures, national projects, and social relations. Through interdisciplinary readings, students will use secondary and primary materials, including chronicles, art, and news reports to explore how natural events have shaped human societies.

Covering more than a two hundred year stretch, we will move across an expansive geography encompassing North Africa, the Levant, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Central Asia. Throughout this journey, particular attention will be paid to five important themes: imperialism, modernization, nationalism, Islam, and revolution. In the process of navigating these seminal topics, we will develop a more nuanced understanding of the modern Middle East and a greater appreciation for the insights offered by primary sources, from poems and national speeches to songs and motion-pictures, into the region’s dynamic past. We will begin with a basic question – what and where is the Middle East? – prior to exploring the impact, importance, and mechanics of empires (Ottoman, French, British). Once elucidating this imperial backdrop, we will study sweeping reforms, struggles for independence, and the fashioning of nation-states, before examining a series of revolutionary moments, America’s presence in the Middle East, and the “Arab Spring” and its aftermath. Whenever possible, we will strive to illuminate ordinary people, as opposed to only elite actors, who contributed to the making of the modern Middle East.",,INT or SOC; WCult:NW,

From the Chicago blues to the Bakersfield Sound; The Grapes of Wrath to Black Boy; the Black Panthers to the Southern Baptist Convention—the influence of the southern migrations can be seen everywhere in American society during these years. Rather than treating the experiences of black and white migrants separately, this course takes a comparative approach to these simultaneous and parallel migrations, focusing on the political and economic factors that drove out-migration from the South; the impact that southern migration had on race relations and labor markets in northern and western cities; the diasporic communities formed by southern migrants in their new homes; and the impact of the migrations on American culture and politics over the course of the 20th century.",,SOC; WCult:W,

Liberalism is not in its death throes, but what talk over a crisis of liberalism has initiated is a discussion about its historical origins, and how liberalism has evolved over time given new political contexts and challenges. The purpose of this course is to help you come to terms with today’s political crisis by looking at challenges to liberalism—as an idea, sensibility and political program—from the Cold War until the present.

To understand the island’s history, students are expected to read what historians and writers have written about Haiti; and to read the primary letters of frantic French planters, rebellious African slaves, egalitarian peasants, entrepreneurial market women, conscientious revolutionaries, exuberant military generals, loquacious politicians, feared dictators, and dreaded militias through time. The course will, indeed, move through four important, though overlapping, historical moments. First, we begin with an examination of the 1791-1804 Haitian Revolution when enslaved Africans revolted against the French colonial planters to successfully abolish slavery and to achieve national independence. Second, we read through the formation of grassroots and institutional democratic traditions in the nineteenth century and how they were undone during the 1915-1934 US Occupation of Haiti, where US President Woodrow Wilson ordered the American military to invade Haiti and control the island for almost two decades. Third, we will explore how the undoing of democracy led to the rise of the Francois and Jean-Claude Duvalier dictatorship (1957-1971) and its dreaded militia called the tonton makout militia (often spelled in the following French orthography: tonton macoutes). Finally, we will conclude the class by looking at how and why the Haitian peasantry overthrew the dictatorship to replace it with the democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide (1991).",,SOC; WCult:NW,

To this end, we will look at rights movements in Middle East, Latin America, and Asian contexts, and attend to the often-complicated history of such movements in the context of imperialism and war. In this course, we will ask: What are human rights, and what is their history? What is the relationship between human rights and earlier languages of rights? What counts as a human right? Can there be a universal standard for human rights despite social difference? What political and ethical possibilities have been opened for marginalized communities by the language of human rights, and what possibilities have been foreclosed by the often-singular focus on human rights as a panacea against all social ills? And finally: do our demands for human rights work to make the world a more just place, and are these demands enough?",,INT or SOC; WCult:NW,

The saints were the link between the human and the divine, and after their death they continued to play an active role in the affairs of the world. Their remains (relics) were powerful, valuable commodities that were revered, bought, and traded; for which the great cathedrals were built; and to which the faithful travelled for thousands of miles, on pilgrimage.

The feature that characterizes and associates the two movements best is their awareness for how form impacts content, or, as Gertrude Stein said, “how writing is written.” The world comes into being and takes shape in the words we use, the texts we write, the images we produce, the movies we shoot, or the maps we draw to name only some of the signifying systems that give the universe a form.",,LIT; WCult:W,

Since the beginning of sound in film, the studios grappled with reaching this linguistically and culturally-diverse demographic. Since the late 20th century, the studios have widely acknowledged the box office power of that group. Time and again, however, the Hollywood industry has failed to accurately identify and engage Latinx peoples on both sides of the US-Mexico border. Applying theories of racialized spectatorship and performance and film genre and authorship, we will interrogate this historically troubled relationship and grapple with its consequences for Latinx representation and inclusion in American cinema.

The course will, indeed, move through four important, though overlapping, historical moments. First, we begin with an examination of the 1791-1804 Haitian Revolution when enslaved Africans revolted against the French colonial planters to successfully abolish slavery and to achieve national independence. Second, we read through the formation of grassroots and institutional democratic traditions in the nineteenth century and how they were undone during the 1915-1934 US Occupation of Haiti, where US President Woodrow Wilson ordered the American military to invade Haiti and control the island for almost two decades. Third, we will explore how the undoing of democracy led to the rise of the Francois and Jean-Claude Duvalier dictatorship (1957-1971) and its dreaded militia called the tonton makout militia (often spelled in the following French orthography: tonton macoutes).

After the democratic systems were reestablished in the region, new facts about the abuse of power by the militaries were disclosed, and a heated debate took place in the public sphere about how to deal with the past. Feature films, documentaries, and fiction and non-fiction literature played an essential role in that debate by providing different strategies of healing scars, honoring victims and survivors, and preserving the memory of both the terror and the grassroots resistance. The experiences and memories of the so-called ""dirty war"" in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay generated not only several fictional renderings of state terrorism during the ""years of lead,"" but also a whole series of testimonios by those directly affected by it, such as the daughters, sons and spouses of desaparecidos who were assassinated by the machinery of state repression.",,LIT; WCult:NW,

In the process of navigating these seminal topics, we will develop a more nuanced understanding of the modern Middle East and a greater appreciation for the insights offered by primary sources, from poems and national speeches to songs and motion-pictures, into the region’s dynamic past. We will begin with a basic question – what and where is the Middle East? – prior to exploring the impact, importance, and mechanics of empires (Ottoman, French, British). Once elucidating this imperial backdrop, we will study sweeping reforms, struggles for independence, and the fashioning of nation-states, before examining a series of revolutionary moments, America’s presence in the Middle East, and the “Arab Spring” and its aftermath.

French political philosopher Étienne de La Boétie (1530–1563) in his seminal essay Discours de la servitude volontaire (Discourse on Voluntary Servitude) presented the existence of a dictatorship as a relationship between two parties. Before every dictator is a population that is willing to accept rule by the dictator. The dictator cannot impose his will on a people that shun a dictatorship. Extrapolating from this concept, we can consider dictatorship to be a syndrome.

But if articulations of love “translate” unspeakable thoughts and desires in the first place, what happens to these articulations when they are re-translated and move across cultures? What’s gained and lost in the process? These translations can be seen as crucibles for cultural encounter and models for self-other relations and gender identity. How have translations challenged (or perpetuated) hegemonic ideas about sexual morality, stylistic propriety, the religious and the profane? How have they been generative in the target literatures and why? We will examine key intersections of love and translation, compare and contrast old and new translations, and become acquainted with key problems in translation theory.",,INT; WCult:NW,

This dislocation manifests itself not only with respect to space, but also in relationship to history, language, political power, and above all in the psychological relationship that diasporic subjects maintain with themselves. This course will focus on two primary examples of diaspora in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Jews and Africans, to examine the multiplicity of relationships among language, literary structure, as well as gender and sexuality that inform the construction of diasporic literatures. Although this course cannot be comprehensive in its survey of either Jewish or African literatures, it will offer suggestive juxtapositions of the two to emphasize commonalities between their historical and political experience.

Despite their internal and mutual conflicts, the two groups share similar experiences of hostility when trying to integrate into American society with fierce antisemitism and Islamophobia against the backdrop of increasing right-wing ethno-nationalism. Concomitantly, both groups share deep ambivalences about assimilating to American culture vs. retaining discrete cultural identities. If Jews and Arabs play decisive roles in US politics, both as effective actors and as imagined targets of opposition, the United States in turn acted not only as mediator in the international relationship between the two groups; the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, post-9/11 politics, anti-terrorist actions, or the Trump administration’s travel ban on five Muslim-dominated countries have also influenced the relationship between Jewish and Arab communities within the United States. Instead of equating the experiences of Jews and Arabs viz-a-viz America, this course examines the multifaceted encounters in what has to be considered a complex Jewish-Arab-American triangular. The ways in which Jews and Arabs interact in the US, will be as central to the course as examples of hybrid cultural experiences of Arab Jews and artefacts such as the numerous American synagogues built in the style of Moorish architecture. We will examine cultural representations of Jews and Arabs in American literature, movies, documentaries, memoirs, art, popular culture and political analyses with attention to aspects of class, race and gender.

In asking how Islamic notions of gender are constructed, we will examine both the roles religious texts have played in shaping Muslim life and how Muslim life in its cultural diversity affects readings of religious texts.

We will consider the appeal of such tropes in particular regional and historical contexts, such as the Reconstruction South, as well as racial or ethnic ones, such as the African American appropriation of Indian resistance, nobility, and genealogies.",,LIT; WCult:W,
NAS,32,Indian Killers: Murder and Mystery in Native American Literature and Film,Taylor,ENGL 53.20,"This course explores the abundant crime fiction and murder mysteries by contemporary Native American artists. These works imagine a democratized space where colonial violence is avenged, American law is malleable, and intellect triumphs over racism. While most critics applaud such decolonizing efforts, we will ask more difficult questions: do these sensational narratives do real cultural work? Do they suggest that colonial violence begets only more violence? And in the end, who are its true victims? Open to all classes. ",,,
NAS,34,Native American Oral Traditional Literatures,Palmer,ENGL 55.14,Native American oral tradition constitutes a rich and complex dimension of the American literary heritage.  This course will examine a range of oral genres from several time periods and tribal sources.  Oral traditions and the textual sources into which they are anthologized provide valuable insights into the nature of human creativity.  They are also full of unique hermentical challenges.  This course will include some contemporary theoretical approaches to orality and the metaphysics of the voice to unpack some of these questions.,,LIT; WCult:NW,
NAS,35,Native American Literature,Taylor,ENGL 32,"Published Native American writing has always incorporated a cross-cultural perspective that mediates among traditions. The novels, short stories, and essays that constitute the Native American contribution to the American literary tradition reveal the literary potential of diverse aesthetic traditions. This course will study representative authors with particular emphasis on contemporary writers. Open to all classes.",,LIT; WCult:NW,
NAS,36,Indigenous Nationalism: Native Rights and Sovereignty,,GOVT 60.05,"This course focuses on the legal and political relationship between the indigenous peoples of Canada, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand and their respective colonial governments. Students will examine contemporary indigenous demands for self-government, especially territorial claims, within the context of the legislative and political practices of their colonial governments. The course will begin with an examination of the notion of Aboriginal self-government in Canada and develop it in light of the policy recommendations found in the recent report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1996). Using the Canadian experience as a benchmark, students will then compare these developments to indigenous peoples' experiences in the United States, Australia and New Zealand. An important theme of the course will be to develop an international approach to the issue of indigenous rights and to explore how colonial governments are responding to indigenous demands for justice.

NAS,38,Lewis and Clark in Indian Country,Calloway,HIST 38.02,"In 1804-06, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark completed a remarkable odyssey, from St. Louis to the Pacific, and back. They wrote more than one million words, describing the country, and paid particular attention to the Indian nations they met. This class will use the abridged edition of the journals to examine the context, experiences , and repercussions of an expedition that initiated journeys of discovery for both the young United States and the Native peoples of the American West.",,SOC; WCult:W,
NAS,40,Language Revitalization,TBA,LING 11.06,"There is currently a measurable reduction in the amount of linguistic diversity around the world as many languages become moribund or cease to be spoken. With greater awareness of language endangerment and attrition, there have been counteracting efforts to maintain and revive the use of many of these languages. In this course we examine the phenomena of language endangerment and language revitalization. We will evaluate the socio-historical reasons for language shift, the rationale for language revitalization and the relative degrees of success in different revitalization programs. There will be a focus on the languages of North America. ",,SOC; WCult:CI,
NAS,41,Native American Literature and the Law,Duthu,,"The Acoma Pueblo poet Simon Ortiz once noted that ""because of the insistence to keep telling and creating stories, Indian life continues, and it is this resistance against loss that has made life possible."" The regenerative and reaffirming force of tribal stories has been most severely tested when confronted by the overwhelming and often destructive power of federal law in Indian affairs. The complex matrix of legal and political relations between Indian tribes and the federal government thus serves as a singularly important arena to examine contested notions of national identity, sovereignty, relationships to lands and people, and concepts of justice. Students will read literary texts produced by Native authors and legal texts involving Indian tribes in an effort to understand how the Native production of stories contributes to the persistence of tribalism in contemporary Native America. Open to all classes.",,LIT; WCult:CI,
NAS,42,Gender Topics in Native American Life, Palmer,WGSS 40.01,"This course will address a range of topics concerning gender that are of particular significance to indigenous communities.  These topics will be considered from historical, political, cultural and social perspectives.  In the context of this class, the term “indigenous” is a category that includes tribal nations of the United States including Hawaii, the First Nations of Canada, and the indigenous people of Australia and New Zealand.  The material is presented with particular concern for the diversity of indigenous groups and the variety of their own experiences and autochthony.  We will explore their responses to misconceptions of tribal gender roles and identities projected upon Native people by the agents and institutions of settler colonialism.  This approach opens a broader discussion about the many actions of indigenous communities to deconstruct and decolonize gender categories that are alien to the continuity, integrity, and vitality of their own traditions.  The interdisciplnary approach of this course will engage texts from philosophy, literature, semiotics, history, and policy, as well as gender studies from various socio-cultural perspectives.",,SOC; WCult:CI,
NAS,47,Contemporary Native American Poetry,,,"Muscogee poet, Joy Harjo has stated that Native Peoples are ""…still dealing with a holocaust of outrageous proportion in these lands…Many of us…are using the 'enemy language' with which to tell our truths, to sing, to remember ourselves during these troubled times.""  This course examines the ways contemporary American Indian and other indigenous poets employ literary gestures of resistance and creativity to outlive the ongoing effects of colonialism. We explore how their poetry contributes to the reclamation and continuity of tribal memory and the regeneration of tribal traditions and communities. Our course includes lyric voices from the reservation, from the city, and from indigenous spaces in dyasporic and global contexts.  We will examine the combined influences that oral tradition, ritual life, and tribal values have on these contemporary poets.   The indigenous poetic voice occupies a unique position in contemporary American poetry, but also in the discourse of settler colonialism. This course traces how the themes of these poetic voices bring forward images of past and contemporary experience, to craft a poetic tradition that is distinctly indigenous. Open to all classes.  ",,LIT; WCult:CI,
NAS,50,Federal Indian Law,Duthu,GOVT 69,"This course will focus on the constitutional, statutory and jurisprudential rules of law that make up the field of Federal Indian Law. Attention will be given to the historical framework from which the rules were derived. After outlining the respective sources and limits of federal, tribal and state political authority in Indian Country, the course will turn to a consideration of subject-specific areas of law, including criminal justice, economic development, environmental and natural resource regulation, hunting and fishing rights, Indian child welfare and preservation of religious and cultural rights.

NAS,51,Pan-Indianism in American History,Crandall,HIST 38.03,"This course provides the history of pan-Indian movements in Indigenous North America from 1680 to the present. In the current era of self-determination, tribal sovereignty, and Indigenous nationhood, we perhaps sometimes forget that pan-Indian movements have played a significant part in the history and experiences of Native peoples of North America. We will explore the many ways in which Native peoples have aligned themselves with other tribal nations religious, military, educational, economic, and environmental movements, in the process cutting across linguistic, cultural, religious, and national lines. Indigenous North Americans have deployed pan-Indianism as a strategy to confront both international such as colonialism and the struggles for control of contested Borderlands, and more regional and localized forces. Taken in its entirety, understanding pan-Indianism is essential to understanding the history of Native North America.",,SOC; WCult:NW,

Washington's world and his life intersected constantly with Native America. He spent much of his life surveying and speculating in Indian lands. He got a crash course in Indian diplomacy at age twenty-one and his mishandling of Indian allies sparked the French and Indian War. He participated in two expeditions against Fort Duquesne (now Pittsburgh) and defended the Virginia frontier against Indian attacks. His break with Britain stemmed in large part from Crown policy that threatened his investments in Indian land. As commander of the Continental Army and then President of the United States, he dispatched armies into Indian country.",,SOC; WCult:NW,
NAS,56,Indigenous North American Borderlands,Crandall,HIST 38.04,"This course focuses on the histories of Indigenous peoples in the borderlands of North America across time in both geographic and thematic contexts. Viewing Native America as an incredibly complex series of borderlands is a useful interpretive model for better understanding the history of Native peoples. Lectures, readings, and class discussion will focus on elements such as cultural contact, conquest and colonialism, missionization, citizenship, gender, and nation. While exploring these various themes, we will touch on some familiar territory such as frontiers and middle grounds, but we will also question our own personal, and often, region-based expertise in order to unpack a more nuanced view of Indigenous borderlands and their significance.",,INT or SOC; WCult:NW,

This course engages various texts that feature Bear imagery in traditional stories, songs, and ritual representations-all vehicles that transmit both sacred and practical knowledge. We use readings in mythopoetics, performance narratives, nature writing, some early ethnographic accounts and recordings, environmental literature, and the contemporary writing of several Native American authors. Discussion about the tribal significance of the Bear is a means to examine ontological distinctions between human self and animal being, and the constructions of human consciousness within the natural world. We also discuss how concepts of ""wildness"" and ""wilderness,"" and ideas about ""control"" and ""freedom"" are expressed within imaginative and geographical spaces.","Open to Juniors and Seniors, and to others with written permission of the instructor.",LIT; WCult:NW,

Indian people were often deceived by treaties and they referred to them as ""pen and ink witch-craft."" But the hundreds of Indian treaties generated unique records of cultural encounter. Each treaty had its own story and cast of characters. Working with the records of key treaties, this seminar will examine the protocols of Indian diplomacy, the maneuverings and agendas of the different participants, as well as the outcomes and legacies of Indian treaties.

PHIL,1,Introduction to Philosophical Topics,,,"Students will engage with central topics, debates and methods in philosophical inquiry. Emphasis is placed on developing critical reading and analytical writing skills.  Readings may draw on both historical and contemporary sources.",,TMV,
PHIL,1.01,The Problems of Philosophy,Plunkett,,"This course acquaints the student with some of the fundamental problems in at least three main areas of Philosophy: Theory of Knowledge, Metaphysics, and Ethics. Questions treated in lectures normally include: Can we know anything, and, if so, how? Does God exist? What is the relation between mind and body? Are our actions free or determined? What makes an act morally right or wrong? Some attention will be paid to the ways in which answers to these questions can be combined to create philosophical systems or total world views. The readings might include both contemporary essays and classic works by such philosophers as Plato, Descartes, and Hume.",,TMV,
PHIL,1.02,Existentialist Ethics,,,"Inescapable freedom – this is what the existentialists held to be the mark of the human condition.  Despite this shared view, however, they each proposed distinct and novel ways of understanding this freedom and its ethical import. To uncover the richness of their analyses of the human condition, the class will explore the complexity of freedom through the lens of core existentialist topics such as radical responsibility, transcendence, nothingness, alterity, inter-subjectivity, finitude, and the absurd.",,DIST: TMV,
PHIL,1.03,Philosophy and Economics,Cruise,,"What makes an economic system fair or unfair?  What does it mean to be economically rational?  How should we evaluate public policy?  How do we know when things go better or worse for a person?  This course will explore a range of fundamental issues in ethics and political philosophy that have deep implications for economic analysis including distributive justice, well-being, and rationality.  It will also examine philosophical perspectives on economic efficiency and social choice theory.",,TMV,
PHIL,1.04,"God, Darwin, and the Cosmos",Lewis,,"This course will examine the relation between science and religion. The course will consider evolution, creationism, and intelligent design. Topics will include the compatibility of Darwinism and theism, and the question whether “Intelligent Design” is a scientific theory. The course will consider questions such as ‘Is the Big Bang evidence for or against the existence of God?’ and ‘Is the fact that the universe is life-permitting evidence for the existence of God? ",,TMV,
PHIL,1.05,"Reasons, Values, Persons",Thomas,,"We will consider such questions as:  What makes a life worth living?  What makes a life a good life?  What, if anything, makes a life a meaningful life? What, if anything, are the grounds of values? What is a person? What relation, exactly, do you bear to the person who first enrolled in this course?  What is freedom? Are you free?  What, if anything, do personhood, freedom and morality have to do with one another?",,TMV,
PHIL,1.06,Classic and Experimental Philosophy,,,"What is God and does she exist? What can we know and what should we believe? Do we have free will? What action is the morally right action? Who or what deserves our care and concern? These fundamental questions about human existence have gripped deep thinkers, from bearded sages to college students, for centuries. What makes this course unique is that we explore these questions and others through readings from traditional philosophical texts and experimental approaches, to see how these questions can be approached by both philosophical and psychological perspectives.",,TMV,
PHIL,1.07,"Life, Death, Relationships, and Meaning",,,"In this course we will philosophize about what is valuable and how to live a life, asking how our answers to those questions are affected by the fact that lives don’t go on forever.",,TMV,
PHIL,1.08,Philosophy of Time & Time Travel,Binkoski,,"On the one hand, time is completely familiar.  On the other, it is a total mystery.  As you might expect, the combination makes for good philosophy.  In this course, we will study a variety of philosophical puzzles concerning the nature of time.  Is time an illusion?  Does time pass?  Is the present special?  Is time travel  possible?  Do the past and future exist? Does time have a direction? What is spacetime?  What are the special and general theories of relativity? What do they imply about the nature of time?",,TMV,
PHIL,1.09,"Science, Superstition, and Skepticism",Lewis,,"Most of us believe that matter is made up of atoms, that smoking causes emphysema, and that the universe is billions of years old. Few believe that Virgos are hot-tempered, that you can see the future through a crystal ball, or that baking soda cures AIDS. We often hear that the difference between such beliefs is that one sort is based on science and the other isn’t. But what makes a method of inquiring into the world distinctively scientific? And what makes us justified in believing on the basis of these methods? This course is an introduction to the philosophical theory of knowledge that focuses on the knowledge that science is purported to offer. Possible topics include competing theories of justification, scientific induction, the nature of explanation, probability, scientific ‘revolutions’, the goals of science, trust in scientific authority, and skepticism.",,TMV,
PHIL,1.10,"Minds, Meanings, and Images",,,"Most things don’t mean anything. How is it that the contents of language and mental states can mean something? How do images represent or depict their objects? What do different answers to such questions tell us about the nature of minds, consciousness, and representation? What do different answers presuppose about reality and our capacity to know it? This course will focus on historical answers to such questions with an eye toward comparing common reference points in contemporary philosophy.",,TMV,
PHIL,1.11,"True, Beautiful, Nasty: Philosophy and The Arts",McNulty,,"Art is often cast as a pleasant distraction, but artists are lionized, ostracized, imprisoned, and even killed. Devotion to sub-genres of music, video games, literature, and street art builds and divides communities. What explains the role of the arts, and artists, in society, and what should their role be? How do positive (nice!) and negative (nasty!) aesthetic responses affect art’s function? Might art be an important, yet non-scientific, approach to understanding our world?  ",,TMV,
PHIL,1.12,Philosophy and Tragedy,,,"Since antiquity philosophers have concerned themselves with tragic drama and its world-view. Why is this powerful and peculiar art-form regarded as both a rival to philosophy and also a site of significant philosophical activity? What philosophical insights or ethical developments are made possible through the depiction of suffering and grief? How does tragedy impact our understanding of human agency and the place of fate and chance in human life? Authors considered may include Homer, Sophocles, Euripides, Plato, Aristotle, Shakespeare, Racine, Beuchner, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Camus, Miller, Nussbaum, Williams.",,TMV,
PHIL,1.13,The Historical Philosophy of W.E.B. Du Bois,Rosario,AAAS 80.10 ENGL 53.40,"This course will examine the historical philosophy of the towering Black scholar and great freedom fighter of the 20th Century.

PHIL,1.14,"Knowledge, Truth, and Power",Binkoski,,"How does and how should social position – race, gender, class – affect our beliefs? What roles does trust play, and ought it to play, in knowledge? How is power implicated in what we can know and in who can be epistemic authorities? Are some agents unjustly epistemically disadvantaged, and if so, how? How ought we to shape our communal interpretive resources? Social epistemology is the study of socially shared beliefs. Some of its core concerns include testimony, disagreement, and the nature of group commitment.",,TMV,
PHIL,1.15,Selves and Stories,,,"Humans are narrators, making sense of themselves and their world. But what are narratives and how do they function? How do narratives engage emotions, desires, and imagination? What sorts of elements belong to narratives? What role does narration play in self-construction? Is it important to have ‘a life-story’? Are narratives an important part of authentic or ethical living? How do narratives differ from other forms of communicative or literary expression? How do individual narratives and social narratives interact? Can narratives serve as arguments or reasons or justifications or explanations? How do narratives figure in human inquiry, human agency, and moral responsibility?",,TMV,
PHIL,1.16,"Morality, Freedom, and the Mind",Thomasson,,"In this course, we will focus on classic philosophical questions about morality, freedom, and the mind. We all have to address moral questions in our everyday lives, but how should we go about answering them? What makes actions right and wrong—is it the consequences of the action, or the principle followed, or something else? We all feel like we are free when we make important decisions. But does it make sense to think we might have free will, given that we are natural creatures, in a world governed by deterministic physical and biological laws? If we don’t have free will, can we be held morally responsible for our actions? Finally, we all think of ourselves not just as physical beings, but as thinking things—as beings who are aware of our world, who have beliefs, thoughts, and hopes. But what is the mind—and what are beliefs, thoughts, hopes? Can the mind be understood as identical with the brain, or mental events as events in the brain? If not, how can talk about the mental be understood? We will examine a variety of approaches to these three central topics through both historical and contemporary philosophical texts.",,TMV,
PHIL,1.17,"Race and Modernity: W.E.B. DuBois, James Baldwin, Lorraine Hansberry",,AAAS 21.10 ENGL 53.43,"This course will examine the classical works of three towering modern intellectuals: W.E.B.

PHIL,1.18,"The Self in Philosophy, Psychology, and Neuroscience",Rosario,,"What makes you, YOU? Is it the sum of your memories, or your brain, or perhaps an immortal soul? In this course, we will cross the centuries together to examine ancient and modern theories of personal identity in philosophy and consider also current empirical perspectives from the cognitive sciences. You will discover canonical readings from historical and contemporary sources in multiple philosophical traditions and discuss how famous clinical cases challenge our thinking about the self.",,TMV,
PHIL,1.19,"Identity, Liberalism, and Democracy",Plunkett,GOVT 30.15,"What would a just form of democracy look like in a pluralistic society that involves people with diverse identities and values? What policies and laws should the state adopt to counter-discrimination and social inequality, and how do they fit (or conflict) with ideals of liberalism? What are social identities, and how do they operate? How are social identities mobilized in different social movements, such as forms of fascism and populism? In this interdisciplinary course, we will examine these and other questions about social identity and its relation to ideals of liberalism, democracy, and justice.",,TMV,
PHIL,3,Reason and Argument,Kulvicki,,"An introduction to informal logic with special attention to the analysis of actual arguments as they arise in daily life as well as in legal, scientific, and moral reasoning.

PHIL,4,Philosophy and Gender,Rosario,WGSS 46.01,"This course will focus primarily on the following questions:  What is feminism?  What is sexism?  What is oppression?  What is gender?  Is knowledge gendered?  Is value gendered?  What is a (gendered) self? What would liberation be?  In exploring these issues, we will examine the ways feminist theorists have rethought basic concepts in core areas of philosophy such as ethics, social and political philosophy, metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of law, and philosophy of mind. Open to all classes.",,TMV; WCult:CI,
PHIL,4.01,Feminist Perspectives on Reproductive Ethics,,WGSS 61.06,"This class focuses on ethical issues concerning human reproduction.  Some of these issues are familiar: Is abortion moral?  Is sex-selection ethical?  Other issues may be less familiar:  Does prenatal testing express a negative message about living with disability?  Is there anything wrong with aiming to have a deaf child? Yet other issues have arisen with the commercialization and globalization of reproduction: Is there anything wrong with selling one’s reproductive labor? Is it ethical to ‘outsource’ pregnancy to Indian surrogates? We will start by looking backward to ethical issues around the introduction of contraception; we will end by looking forward, to the promise of same-sex reproduction through in vitro-gametogenesis, and reproduction via artificial gestation.  While we will consider numerous perspectives on each issue, special consideration will be given to feminist viewpoints.  ",,TMV,
PHIL,5,Philosophy and Medicine,Bumpus,,"An examination of some philosophical issues in the field of medicine.

Topics include symbolization, truth tables, truth trees, interpretations, and derivations. Each week one lecture, three quiz days, and three afternoon individualized discussion sessions are offered (normally MWF 4:45-5:15pm). The individual discussion sessions allow students to pursue their questions and obtain feedback on quizzes on a one-on-one basis.

PHIL,8,Introduction to Moral Philosophy,Walden,,"An introduction to the foundations and nature of ethics. Questions may include:  What is the good life? What is it for something to have value? Are there acts that ought never to be done, no matter the consequences? Is ethics objective or relative to different perspectives? We inevitably make assumptions whenever we offer ethical verdicts about particular cases. This course aims to think systematically about those assumptions. Open to all classes. ",,TMV,

PHIL,9.01,Reproductive Ethics,Bumpus,,"What do we owe human life, once it has begun to develop? Is a woman morally required to continue gestating a fetus, once it has begun developing?  Does the answer depend upon whether or not the fetus is a person?  Some forms of assisted reproduction yield a surplus of human embryos.  Is using these embryos for research moral? Is it moral to dispose of them?  What may we do in the interest of creating human life?  We tend to grant people broad procreative liberty. Should deaf couples be allowed to select for deafness?  And what about choosing enhanced traits for our children?  Some people worry we are facing a future where the rich can design their babies – choosing to create a musical prodigy or a baby Einstein – but the poor cannot.  If so, is distributive justice the only concern about such a future?  ",,TMV,
PHIL,9.02,Environmental Ethics,Binkoski,,"This course provides a general introduction to ethical problems concerning the environment. The course will cover some standard positions in the field, including biocentrism (the thesis that all living organisms have intrinsic moral worth) and ecocentrism (the thesis that entire natural systems have intrinsic moral worth).

PHIL,9.04,The Ethics of Food Choice and Food Policy,,,"In this course, we will consider ethical questions for food production, food consumption and food policy. How do ethical values interact with our food choices? Should we support the production of local and organic food? If so, why? If not, why not? Are there compelling moral reasons to adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet? Is it possible to be an ethical omnivore? Do current production practices or food policies have a disproportionately negative impact on some populations? How, if at all, should practices or conditions in the food industry influence our behavior as consumers? In the course of our discussions, we will consider the ethics of harm, distributive justice, complicity, death and obligations to future generations.",,TMV,
PHIL,9.06,"Friends, Lovers, and Comrades: Ethical Issues of Special Relationships",,,"This course will investigate philosophical issues that arise in our relationships with other people.

It encapsulates the break from prior Scholastic and Renaissance traditions in philosophy and science and becomes hugely influential in setting the agenda of western philosophy—in epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, ethics, political philosophy, etc.—through the 20th century and up to today.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV; WCult:W,
PHIL,13.01,17th Century Rationalists,,,"A study of central themes in the works of the three most celebrated philosophers of the seventeenth century: Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz. Metaphysics and epistemology will be our focus, and the topics we’ll explore include mind, matter, necessity, contingency, truth, causation, space, time, knowledge, reason and the existence of God. We’ll approach their philosophy through a variety of their texts, in English translation, including treatises, papers, dialogues, letters and unpublished drafts and notes.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV; WCult:W,
PHIL,13.02,British Empiricism,,,"The Empiricists believed that concepts and knowledge are sourced exclusively in the senses. This position found its most detailed presentation in John Locke (1632-1704), George Berkeley (1685-1753), and David Hume (1711-1776). It led to a picture of the mind, how it relates to the world, and how this leads to knowledge that is still influential today. This course develops that picture, with an eye to the philosophical context in which it came about and its influence on subsequent generations. In addition to Locke, Berkeley, and Hume, other (mainly British) writers considered might include Thomas Hobbes, Margaret Cavendish, Anne Conway, Catharine Cockburn, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Damaris Masham, Frances Hutcheson, Thomas Reid, and Mary Shepard.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV; WCult:W,
PHIL,13.03,The British Moralists,Walden,,"During the late Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, Britain was the site of especially vigorous and fertile debates about some central issues in moral philosophy. This course explores those debates, including: the nature of moral judgment, the objectivity of moral principles, the dynamics of the moral sentiments, the motivational potential of moral responses, the freedom of the will, and the moral characteristics of the sexes.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV; WCult:W,
PHIL,16,Late Modern Philosophy,,,"In this course students will engage with figures and topics from the period initiated by Kant's Critique of Pure Reason in 1781 and ending, roughly, with Nietzsche's last work in 1888. Figures may include: Kant, Herder, Schleiermacher, Reinhold, Schelling, Schlegel, Fichte, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Feuerbach, Marx, Bolzano, Brentano, Meinong, Mill, and Nietzsche. Topics may include: idealism and realism, materialism, social and political philosophy, religion, value, existentialism, psychologism, logic, semantics, philosophy of cognition, and philosophical methodology.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV; WCult:W,
PHIL,16.01,Self-Consciousness in German Idealism,,,Our theories of action and knowledge are condemned to fail if they are not guided by a philosophically fundamental inquiry into the nature of self-consciousness.  Kant maintains a modest version of this thesis.  Fichte and Hegel make it the key to their ambitious systematic philosophies.  This course aims to isolate and evaluate the basic insights that animate German Idealism.,"One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV; WCult:W,
PHIL,16.02,"Kant on Moral, Legal, and Political Philosophy",Rosenkoetter,,"According to Kant’s influential account of morality, how an agent understands her own actions determines their moral status.  An act that is innocuous in its external guise might be morally problematic because of its internal principle.  Kant supplements this with an account of how we ought to relate to other persons in external respects.  This “doctrine of right” offers a compelling alternative to more widely known political and legal philosophies.  This class will provide a unified introduction to both parts of Kant’s attempt to understand the normative implications of agency.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV; WCult:W,
PHIL,16.03,Hegel and Marx,McNulty,,"This course concerns two towering figures of the nineteenth century, Hegel and Marx. Our goal is to explore their contrasting views of modern society, especially the modern market economy. We begin with Hegel’s Philosophy of Right, an attempt to show that modern society promotes human freedom. We then turn to Marx’s Paris Manuscripts and Capital, considering his case for the revolutionary overthrow of this society. Topics discussed along the way may include private property, individual rights, human nature, alienation, exploitation, civil society, democracy, false consciousness, and ideology critique.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,19,History of 19th/20th Century Philosophy,Spink,,"This course treats philosophical topics and figures in the rich and influential period that spans the 19th and 20th centuries. Topics may include: subjectivity, agency, power, atomism, idealism, positivism, critiques of metaphysics, ideology, psychologism, the unconscious, intentionality, consciousness, analysis, naturalism and modality. Prerequisite: One course in philosophy or permission of the instructor.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV; WCult:W,
PHIL,19.01,Wittgenstein,Kulvicki,,"An investigation of Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy, its sources, and its enduring significance. The main line of the course traces the logical atomism of his early years through his rejection of it as dogmatic and the subsequent development of his thoughts about meaning, mind, language games, and rule-following. Other topics might include his philosophy of mathematics, his remarks on color, or his aesthetics and value theory.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV; WCult:W,
PHIL,19.02,Transcendental Philosophy in Husserl and Heidegger,,,"Transcendental philosophy seeks to uncover conditions for the possibility of experience. This course will study the ways in which Husserl and Heidegger develop and refine Kant’s transcendental project in the course of their phenomenological investigations, in part by broadening the range of human experience that is subject to philosophical scrutiny. Time will be one focus of the course, as we seek to reconstruct Heidegger’s claim that different conceptions of time yield different understandings of what it is to be.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV; WCult:W,
PHIL,19.03,Positivism and Ordinary Language Philosophy,,,"As the natural sciences developed and branched off from philosophy, philosophers faced the question: What is left for philosophy to do? This crisis led philosophers in the positivist and ordinary language traditions to reexamine the role of philosophy, the boundaries between the meaningful and the nonsensical, and the possibility of metaphysics. In this class, we will study the motivations, methods, and results of each approach, as well as examining prominent criticisms raised against them.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV; WCult:W,
PHIL,22,Feminism and Philosophy,,,"This course examines the relationship between feminism and philosophy. The focus is on such questions as: Is the Western philosophical canon inherently sexist? How should feminist philosophers read the canon? Are Western philosophical concepts such as objectivity, reason, and impartiality inherently masculinist concepts? The course may focus on either the ways in which feminists have interpreted great figures in the history of philosophy (e.g., Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Hume, Kant, Nietzsche), or on the ways in which feminists have rethought basic concepts in core areas of philosophy (e.g., epistemology, ethics, metaphysics, political philosophy, philosophy of science), or both. Open to all classes.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV; WCult:CI,
PHIL,23,Art and Aesthetics,,,"What is art, and what’s the point of it? Does it help us understand the world better or enjoy it more? Does art distract us from what is really important? What is beauty, and ought the arts aim at producing it? What are representation, expression, and realism, and how do they figure in different art forms? The course addresses combinations of these questions through both reading philosophy and engaging with artwork.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",ART,
PHIL,23.01,Ethics and the Arts,Walden,,"From novels, films, and television to painting, sculpture, and symphonies, the influence of art on our character, our values, and how we see the world is pervasive. This raises a number of important philosophical questions at the intersection of ethics and the philosophy of art. Do both moral properties like goodness and aesthetic properties like beauty exist only ""in the eye of the beholder"", or are one or both of them more objective? Can we learn things about what is good and right, or how to be better people from reading great literature or seeing important paintings? How might the moral character of a work of art affect its aesthetic merit? Is Birth of a Nation, for example, a worse film because of its racism?","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,23.02,Philosophy and the Cinematic Arts,,,"Moving images introduce new questions and problems in philosophy of art, and they offer new perspectives on old ones. How does film differ from the other arts? Do moving images represent time, and if so, do they do it in a pictorial manner? In what critical, aesthetic, and representational respects does cinema differ from theater, painting, and the other mimetic arts? Did cinema introduce new possibilities for realism into artistic practice? How should we understand the tangled relationship between photography and cinema? How does the study of moving images relate to problems in other areas of philosophy, like the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of language?","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",ART,
PHIL,23.03,Art and Its Nature,Thomasson,,"What is the nature of art? Can ‘art’ be defined, or do attempts at definition illegitimately constrain creative innovation in the arts? What sorts of things are paintings, songs, or works of literature? How are they related to things such as colored canvases, scores, the cultural context, artists, and audiences? Are there important differences in kind among arts like painting, literature, and music? This course will investigate these and other questions about the definition and ontology of art.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",ART,
PHIL,24,Law and Philosophy,Cruise,,Legal practice raises a wide range of questions of interest to philosophers.  Some concern how best to understand central concepts invoked in laws:  What are contracts? What is free speech? Other questions concern what kinds of laws and legal institutions we should have: What kinds of laws should regulate hate speech? When is the state justified in using coercion to enforce laws?  Still other questions concern law itself: How are legal norms related to moral norms?,"One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV; WCult:W,
PHIL,25,Philosophy of Cognitive Science,Roskies,COGS 025,"What is the mind and how can we model it? Cognitive science offers a distinctive approach to some of the great philosophical questions about the mind. But what does it tell us? This course will cover the classical foundations of cognitive science, and some of the more recent developments in the field. We will study the computational theory of the mind and its implications, connectionism, theories of embodiment, dynamical systems, and recent statistical approaches to cognition. (Not open to students who received credit for PHIL 010/COGS 11.01.) ","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TAS,
PHIL,26,Philosophy and Computers,Ratoff,COGS 026,The accomplishments of artificial intelligence research and the widespread use of computers in our society confront us with many interesting philosophical questions. What are the limits of artificial intelligence? Could computers ever think or feel? Is the Turing test a good test? Are we really computers? Are there decisions computers should never make? Do computers threaten our privacy in special ways? This course will consider such issues in order to explore the philosophical implications of computing. Open to all classes.,"One Philosophy course, one Cognitive Science course, one Computer Science course, or permission of the instructor.",TAS,
PHIL,27,Philosophy of Science,Lewis,,"In this course students examine the history, practices, methods and assumptions of the natural and social sciences. Topics may include:  the objects and methods of scientific inquiry; causation and explanation; the structure and function of laws and theories; the role of mathematics and models in science; scientific representation; induction and probability; scientific revolutions; the intersections of science and value; and the sociology of science.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,28,Phenomenology and Existentialism,Thomasson,,"This course examines the traditions of phenomenology and existentialism, primarily through a study of German, Austrian, and French philosophy from the first half of the twentieth century, but also including more recent work inspired by these traditions. Major historical figures covered in this course may include: Franz Brentano, Edmund Husser!, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Emmanuel Levinas. Special topics may include: the nature of subjectivity or consciousness; theories of intentionality; phenomenology and post-phenomenology; historicity; freedom and responsibility; existentialist theories of oppression; and existentialist ethics.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV; WCult:W,
PHIL,28.01,Heidegger's Being and Time,,,"This course will focus on Heidegger’s Being and Time. Topics to be discussed include: the foundations of metaphysics, knowing-how vs. knowing-that, agency, practical reason, social identity, social ontology, philosophical methodology, and the phenomenology of everyday experience.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV; WCult:W,
PHIL,28.02,Phenomenology and the Mimetic Arts,,,"Phenomenology offers a distinctive approach to philosophical problems because it is centered on unpacking the structure and content of experience. This course introduces students to phenomenological methods, and then focuses these techniques on the mimetic arts. The arts of imitation – figurative painting and sculpture, photography, film, theater, and so on – are particularly phenomenologically interesting. Experiences of them are complex because they involve awareness of the representations as well as what they represent, among other things. As such, they are both excellent candidates for phenomenological analysis, as well as test cases for phenomenological methods. This course will consider both classical and contemporary thinkers in the phenomenological tradition, as well as their critics.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV; WCult:W,
PHIL,29,Philosophy of Logic and Mathematics,Walden,,"Logic and philosophy of mathematics are ancient fields of study and have also flowered in recent times. Courses in this rubric study principles, results and methods of logic (whether in 'classical' or 'non-classical' systems) or philosophical issues concerning the interpretation of logic and mathematics (e.g., what justifies the rules of inference? what is mathematics about? what is logical or mathematical truth? what does a proof prove?). Emphasis may be historical or contemporary.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,29.01,Of Time and Necessity: Philosophy of Logic,,,"Often we reason about what is now, actually the case. But often we also reason about what was or will be. Or about what could or might or would have been; or about what must be, even if some things could have been otherwise. What are the correct rules for this? What, if anything, makes them correct? We shall develop some elementary parts of modal and temporal logic and consider their interpretation and philosophical significance.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,29.02,The Infinite,,,"Infinity is an indispensable concept for mathematics. Arithmetic deals with infinitely many natural numbers, geometry with infinitely long lines, calculus with infinitely small changes, and set theory with multiple levels of infinity. But the infinite raises distinctive philosophical problems. Just what is our concept of the infinite? A completed totality larger than any finite totality? Something that extends beyond all bounds? What justifies us in applying this concept? Are there larger and smaller levels of infinity? How many? Moreover, how are we to deal with the paradoxes that arise from the concept? The infinite also has a related, but arguably distinct use in certain philosophical debates where it is used to denote ideas of perfection or completeness, e.g. of the divine or human reason. What is the relationship between this notion of the infinite and its use in mathematics? Readings will include historical and contemporary sources, from Aristotle to Cantor to today.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,30,Epistemology and Methodology,Lewis,,"This course deals with the nature of inquiry.  Which methods of inquiry should we rely on? Can we know or understand anything? Of what value are knowledge and understanding?  Topics covered may include skepticism, the methodologies of science, mathematics and philosophy, the social nature of knowledge, self-knowledge, the nature of memory and knowledge of the past.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,31,Metaphysics,Rosario,,"This course will focus on one or more central topics in metaphysics, possibly including the existence and nature of the divine, the infinite, free will, personal identity, the self, actions and intentions, space and time, change, the nature of properties, truth, necessity and modality.  ","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,31.01,Space and Time,Lewis,,"In this course, we will consider some historically significant questions about the nature of space, time and spacetime. How are space, time and change related? Is space some kind of substance or container for events? Or is space a relation between things? Is time mind-dependent? How, if at all, is motion or persistence through space and time possible? Are the past, present and future equally real? Is time travel possible?","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,31.04,Realism and AntiRealism,,,"In this course, we will explore a portion of the complex web of debates between realists and antirealists.  Questions we will consider include: What is realism? On what bases do we commit to the existence of something? To what extent, if any, are objects of experience and inquiry (e.g. colors, values, natural laws, numbers) independent of the mind? What role, if any, does the mind play in the construction or conception of meanings, properties or things? What role does language play in determining ontological commitments? What is truth? What, if anything, do distinct conceptions of meaning, objectivity and truth suggest about the nature of reality or about the mind's capacity to determine or to know what is real?","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,31.05,"Time, Truth and Fate",,,If it’s already true that I’ll die in an avalanche tomorrow or else that I won’t—logic says it’s one or the other—is it pointless to take precautions? Is everything fated to happen as it does? Is the future open? Can we change the past? Is anything real apart from the present? Does the present exist? Does the truth about time require different rules of logic? We’ll draw on sources from Aristotle to today.,"One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,31.06,"Free Will, Agency and Responsibility",,,"What sorts of agents are we? Do we have free will? Are we ever truly the authors of our actions? Does science—whether physics or psychology or neuroscience—promise to give us the answers? What are the consequences for moral responsibility? The metaphysical, scientific and social dimensions of these classic questions in philosophy run deep through their history and are focal points of contemporary discussion.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,31.07,The Social World,Thomasson,,"Our world is rife with social entities such as money, states, clubs, and corporations. But what are these things? They seem as real as trees or mountains, yet at least some seem to be constructed by our beliefs and practices in ways that other physical things are not. This course explores questions about what social objects and social groups are, how they differ from natural objects, and how we can acquire knowledge of them.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,31.08,Puzzles of the Material World,,,"The world around us seems to be populated with familiar objects of all sorts: plants and animals, tables and chairs, rivers and mountains. Yet a range of puzzles and paradoxes have been raised to do with the vagueness of ordinary objects, their relationship to the matter that makes them up, and the apparent rivalry between scientific and everyday descriptions of the world. Might ordinary objects be an illusion? What does the material world truly contain? Can we save our common-sense view of the world?","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,32,Intermediate Logic,,,"An investigation of three branches of symbolic logic: first-order predicate logic with identity, sentential modal logic, and predicate modal logic. Topics to be covered may include Russell's theory of definite descriptions; the treatment of non-denoting terms in logics known as ""free logics;"" investigations of various modalities, involving pairs of concepts such as necessity and possibility, being obligatory and being permitted, and being known and being believed; Kripke-style ""possible world"" semantics.","PHIL 6, or MATH 39 or MATH 69, or permission of the instructor.",QDS,
PHIL,34,Language and Thought,Thomas,,"Studies of language and cognition play central and defining roles in the history and development of philosophy. Students will investigate the nature of language and its relations to logic, thought and reality.  Specific topics may include theories of signs, meaning, reference, truth, and speech acts.  Other possibilities include necessity, analyticity, tensed statements, counterfactual conditionals, indexicals, pragmatics, metaphor, intentionality and vagueness.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,35,Mind and Psychology,,,"The mind is both a part of the world and the source of our perspectives on it. A variety of approaches to understanding the mind consider such questions as: What is consciousness? What is it to think about things? How does the world as we know it through the sciences allow for conscious, thinking creatures to exist? Are there unconscious thoughts and desires? Can psychology, neuroscience, philosophy and psychiatry help us answer these questions?","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,35.01,Theories of Consciousness,Ratoff,COGS 50.04,"Conscious experience is at once both completely familiar and utterly mysterious: how is it that electrical activity in a lump of grey matter – the brain – gives rise to the Technicolor phenomenology of our conscious experience? If human beings are just biological machines, then how is possible that we have a subjective point of view on the world? Why are we not just mindless robots, that produce behavior in light of stimulations from the environment, but lack any inner awareness or consciousness? In this class we will read, and bring together in conversation, cutting edge work from philosophy, psychology, and the neurosciences on the nature of consciousness.","One Philosophy course, one cognitive science course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,36,Metaethics,Rosenkoetter,,"This course explores foundational questions about ethics.   For instance: What, if anything, makes an ethical judgment correct? Are ethical facts created or discovered? Can ethical judgments ever be objectively true, or are they only true ""from a point of view?"" How are ethical judgments related to natural science and the picture of the world it offers us? How can we come to justified beliefs about ethics?","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,37,Ethical Theory,Bumpus,,"This course is broadly concerned with questions about what is right, good and virtuous.  Some instances of the course will treat abstract questions.  For example: Are moral principles universal or relative to a particular group? Is an act right just in case it maximizes happiness? Do we have good reason to be moral? More focused instances might include: Do we have duties to non-humans? When is it morally permissible to kill a person?","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,37.01,Consequences and Contracts,,,"Ethical theory begins with questions about the foundations of morality: Why should I care about other people at all? It then asks very general questions about what shape our duties to self and others should take: Given that I owe something to other people, do I owe them pleasure? Happiness? To help them pursue their projects? To solicit their consent? This class is devoted to two systems of answers to these questions. The first, consequentialism, holds that the moral status of an action is primarily a matter of whether it brings about good or bad consequences. The second, contractualism, understands moral principles as grounded in a hypothetical contract between agents.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,38,Social and Political Philosophy,,,"Through the study of classical and contemporary texts in political and social theory, we will consider such issues as how and to what extent (if at all) political authority can be justified, what the criteria are for distributive justice, and how social and political inequalities (such as those based on race and gender) should be conceptualized and addressed.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,38.01,"Equality, Justice, and Democracy",Plunkett,,"What is the nature of equality? How much does equality matter in ethics and politics? And why (if at all) does equality matter in the first place? This course concerns these and related questions about the role of equality in evaluating the social and political world. One of our central concerns will be how equality relates to other (purportedly important) ethical and political values, including justice, democracy, and freedom.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,38.02,"Ethics, Politics, and the Law",Plunkett and Muirhead,GOVT 86.41,"This interdisciplinary course will examine normative issues about ethics, politics, and the law. Specific question studied might include the following: When is the state justified in using coercive force to secure compliance with the law? How should we proceed with those who disagree with us about normative questions within a democratic, pluralistic society? Are there correct answers to normative questions at all, and (if so) how might we improve in learning about them?","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,38.03,"Race, Justice, and the Law",Plunkett and Muirhead,GOVT 86.45,"The last few years has seen increased calls for “racial justice” by a range of actors across the USA. How should we evaluate these calls? For example: what exactly is racial justice? What would it mean for our society to achieve more of it? And what methods for achieving it are (and are not) permissible in a pluralistic, democratic society? We will approach these and related questions by engaging with theories of racial justice, general theories of justice, and theories of race and racism. As part of our discussion, we will also engage with debates about more specific social/political issues tied to debates about racial justice, including such issues as mass incarceration, the foundations of criminal law, affirmative action, antidiscrimination law, propaganda, ideology critique, and political speech.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,39,Critical Theory and Post-Structuralism,,,"This course examines themes in 20th and 21st century French and German philosophy, with a focus on critical social theory of the Frankfurt School and French post-structuralism, and contemporary work inspired by these traditions.  Figures covered in this course may include:  Adorno, Horkheimer, Habermas, Foucault, Deleuze, Derrida, and Honneth.

PHIL,39.01,Foucault,,,"This course will focus on the work of Michel Foucault. Foucault’s work, which combined historical and philosophical inquiry in innovative ways, helped shape many discussions across the humanities and social sciences in the second half of the twentieth century, and continues to be influential today. We will discuss Foucault’s thinking about a range of topics, including ones such as genealogy, power, discourse, sexuality, biopolitics, truth, knowledge, subjectivity, social identity, agency, and philosophical methodology.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV; WCult:W,

PHIL,45.01,Paradoxes and Puzzles,,,"Paradoxes have played influential roles in philosophical investigations since antiquity. Paradoxes figure both in arguments for important philosophical theses and in (alleged) refutations of substantive positions. This course considers a selection of celebrated paradoxes along with important attempts to solve them. Students will consider topics in a variety of fields, possibly including philosophy of language, logic, ethics, decision theory, metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophical methodology.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",,
PHIL,45.02,"God, Belief, and Evil",,,"God is supposed to be a perfect being: all-knowing, all-powerful, and perfectly good. Famously, there are 'proofs' of God's existence, and 'proofs' to show the opposite. What should we think? This class explores the question of God's nature and existence, and what it means for human belief and action. What are the divine attributes? How strong are the arguments for or against God's existence? Can religious belief be rational? How could a perfect God permit evil? Can there be morality without God?","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",,
PHIL,45.03,Consent in Philosophy and Law,,,"What is consent? Despite its enormous moral and legal centrality, the idea of consent seems flawed in important ways. It is not obvious what counts as consent, or what makes it reasonable to believe in consent. Consent can be coerced, or unwilling. Ideally, consent and refusal are instantaneous powers conferring recognized permission or obligation on recipients. In real life, however, particularly for women, consent and refusal can be ignored, dismissed, misunderstood, or deemed irrelevant. We will examine the concept of consent in legal theory and moral philosophy to move towards a better understanding of it in sexual contexts.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,45.04,Embodied Cognition,,,"This course critically examines approaches in the philosophy of mind and cognitive science that see our psychological capacities as importantly dependent on our bodily form and abilities, and our environmental surroundings. We will examine how this view of mind as essentially ‘embodied and embedded’ arose in reaction to the classical ‘cognitivist’ paradigm in cognitive science that understands psychological capacities in terms of computational processes implemented by the brain, consider various ways in which the body and environment might contribute to explanations of cognition, and look at the prospects and challenges for embodied cognitive science in various domains.","One Philosophy course, or permission of the instructor.",,

PHIL,50.09,Personal Identity and the Self,,,"What sorts of beings are we? Embodied psychologies? Thinking animals? Moral agents? Narrative constructs? The metaphysical questions are abiding ones because of their intrinsic interest, and also because of their rich connections to developing theories of human biology, psychology, value, freedom, and agency. We will investigate which features, if any, are essential to the sorts of beings we are. We will ask after the grounds for existence and persistence of such beings across time (e.g. biological capacities, self-reflective capacities, rational agency). We will consider models of self-constitution, self-knowledge and self-deception. If time permits, the course will conclude with an exploration of the impact of psychological fragmentation on personhood, self-constitution and agency.","Two Philosophy courses, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,50.14,"Property, Markets, and Capitalism",,,"Property is a fundamental topic in political philosophy, legal theory and the social sciences. This course integrates philosophical theories of property rights with social scientific perspectives on social cooperation and economic perspectives on private law.  It explores the implications of recent work in these areas for broader questions about economic inequality, the fairness of market outcomes, constitutional limitations on state authority, and the proper balance between private control and public regulation.","Two Philosophy courses, or permission of the Instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,50.15,Neuroethics,Roskies,,"The brain is the seat of who we are. This course will examine ethical issues that arise from our growing understanding of the brain, and our consequent ability to monitor and manipulate it. We will discuss timely issues such as cognitive enhancement, the ethics of brain interventions, drugs, and neural gene therapies, and the possibility of mindreading. Later in the course we will examine the ways in which our growing knowledge of the biological basis of moral cognition may or may not have effects on our moral theorizing.","Two Philosophy courses, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,50.17,Global Expressive Rights,,,"Does the right to free speech have boundaries? Philosophical defenses of the right to free speech, developed in the context of the town square and the printing press, have yet to catch up with the revolution in communication brought about by the Internet. Technological innovations such as social media have made it possible to communicate instantaneously with hundreds of millions of people around the world and have, for purposes of regulating speech, rendered national boundaries virtually irrelevant. There is now an urgent need to determine how to assess and protect the values of free speech in this global context. Questions we will discuss include: Is there a universal human right to freedom of expression? If so, what is the philosophical basis for it? What are its limits?

How should the different free speech regimes currently in effect in different countries be reconciled in cases of conflict?","Two Philosophy courses, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,50.18,Animal Minds,,,"This course focuses on questions about the minds of nonhuman animals. We will consider what kind of thought, if any, is possible for beings that lack language. Can animals have propositional thought? What limits are there on the contents of nonlinguistic thought? We will also consider other aspects of mentality: Can animals feel pain? Can they suffer? Are they conscious? Finally, we will consider the ethical implications of the answers we find to the above questions.","Two Philosophy courses, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,50.20,The Social Mind,,,"This course addresses the question of how we understand other people’s behaviour.  It examines contemporary philosophical theories concerning how we think about another’s thoughts, and related questions such as whether this ability is unique humans, universal across cultures, and how it may develop.    The course is strongly interdisciplinary, drawing on sources from developmental psychology, neuroscience and anthropology, to support philosophical arguments.  However, no prior knowledge of these fields is required to take the course.","Two Philosophy courses, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,50.21,Current Research in Social/Political Philosophy,,GOVT 86.30,"What kind of society should we aim to have? And why should we aim to have that kind of society as opposed to some other kind? And are there objectively right answers to these two previous questions, or are there ultimately only answers that are correct relative to a given social/historical framework? These three abstract questions have long been at the heart of social/political philosophy, from Aristotle and Plato to the present day. They are also questions that matter tremendously to a wide range of citizens in our increasingly globalized world: a world in which different societies, with different cultures, different social/political structures, and different moral values come into increased contact with other. This course will be focused on these three interconnected questions. It will be an advanced discussion-based seminar, and will involve multiple visiting speakers. All students will be expected to have at least two previous courses in philosophy or in political theory.","Two Philosophy courses, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,50.22,Value,Walden,,"What is it for something to be valuable or disvaluable?  Are there irreducible truths about value?  Are knowledge and achievement per se valuable?  Or can their value ultimately be explained by the value of happiness?  Are persons valuable in a way that cannot be captured by the sum total of their happiness, knowledge, and the like?  What role should truths about value play in ethics as a whole?","Two Philosophy courses, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,50.23,Virtue Ethics,,,"Contemporary virtue ethics arises out of a long and illustrious history in which ethics focuses on moral character traits. Do virtues (e.g. honesty, courage) exist? If so, what are they? Are they dispositions grounded in nature, traits acquired by education and training, or some combination of both? How are virtues related to practical deliberation, action and emotions? How are virtues related to human flourishing? How promising is virtue ethics relative to other approaches in normative ethics?","Two Philosophy courses, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,50.24,Moral Epistemology,,,"Ethical disagreements range from the ethics of abortion to foundational questions about the basic structure of ethics (such as whether or not consequentialism is true). What is the significance of such disagreements for deciding what to believe in ethics? Do moral disagreements provide support for moral skepticism? How, if at all, can we make progress in ethical inquiry? Parallel questions, as they arise in other domains (e.g. mathematics, political philosophy, and epistemology itself) will be examined.","Two Philosophy courses, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,50.25,Moral Sentimentalism,,,"Sentimentalists believe that moral judgments are based on affective states—roughly, emotions—and that the institution of morality is in some sense a construction out of these states. What are the origins of moral approbation and disapprobation? Is there such a thing as a “moral sense”? What role does sympathy or empathy play in moral psychology? How are moral sentiments related to practical deliberation? Are moral judgments the product of reason or passion? How do complex moral attitudes evolve? What role do social forces play in shaping moral sentiments? Is there empirical evidence for or against sentimentalism? What are the implications of moral sentimentalism for non-cognitivist approaches to moral discourse? Readings will include both classic sentimentalist texts of the 18th Century—Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, Hume, and Smith—and their latter-day descendants.","Two Philosophy courses, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,50.26,Philosophy and the Quantum World,,,"Many striking claims have been made on the basis of quantum mechanics—that the future is undetermined, that an object can be in two places at once, that consciousness has a special causal role, that the future can affect the past, and so on. Quantum mechanics is an incredibly powerful theory; but it is also a deeply troubled theory, and it is far from obvious what it says. In this course we will study quantum theory, its central difficulty (the measurement problem), and options for avoiding the difficulty. We will also evaluate philosophical claims that have been made on the basis of quantum mechanics. No acquaintance with modern physics will be presupposed.","Two Philosophy courses, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,50.27,Categories,,,"What is there? What are the most fundamental kinds of beings and how are they related to nonfundamental beings? Is it possible to develop a system of categories to identify the highest genera of being and to map the basic structure of reality? Do categories sort extramental entities or concepts or cognitive structures? Are they determined by logic or language? Philosophy is rich with competing attempts to develop categorical systems of reality, cognition, and meaning. This course will examine both historical and contemporary approaches to categories and their importance, including skeptics of the entire undertaking. Authors to be considered may include Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Ockham, Suárez, Kant, Frege, Husserl, Heidegger, Ryle, Chisholm, Strawson, Dummett, Westerhoff, Lowe, and Brandom.","Two Philosophy courses, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,50.28,Philosophy of Time,,,"In this seminar we will explore the nature of time and temporal phenomena. Topics include: Does time pass? Do the past and future exist? What light does special relativity shed on the nature of the present? Is an object fully present at a time, or only a temporal part of it? What explains the temporal asymmetries of our experience? Could the world be fundamentally non-temporal? ","Two Philosophy courses, or permission of the Instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,50.30,Freedom of Expression,,,"What does it mean to express oneself? Are there special reasons not to limit people’s freedom of expression? If protecting freedom of expression is profoundly important, does this mean that even hate speech (for example) must be protected? What limits can there be? These are some of the questions we will take up in this class. The first part of the course will study foundational questions about the nature and value of freedom of expression. The second part of the course will then examine specific topics including obscenity, pornography, hate speech, privacy, and corporate speech. We will conclude with a critical discussion of several recent Supreme Court decisions on freedom of expression.","Two Philosophy courses, or permission of the Instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,50.31,Classics of Modern Aesthetics,,,"This course introduces students to philosophical aesthetics and the philosophy of art through some of the central works of those fields from the 18th Century onwards. Potential questions include: the nature of aesthetic pleasure, the special features of aesthetic judgments, the beautiful and the sublime, the moral potential of art, the relationship between art and freedom, the characteristic aims of art, what makes an experience aesthetic, and the role of symbolism in the arts.","Two Philosophy courses, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,50.32,Love and Respect,Rosario,,"Morality seems to involve distinctive attitudes toward other people-distinctive ways of feeling and regarding other people. What are these distinctive attitudes of moral consideration? In this course we examine two candidates: love and respect. We will consider both the question of what these attitudes ultimately involve, when and why they are merited, and the prospects for moral systems built around them.","Two Philosophy courses, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,50.33,Necessity and Possibility,Thomasson,,"Modal talk is central to a great range of philosophical discussions, in areas from ethics to metaphysics to philosophy of mind and philosophy of science. But talk about what is possible or necessary is puzzling. For, as Hume noted, we never seem to observe anything like necessity in the world. Can talk about what is necessary or possible be true or false? If so, are there parts of reality (other possible worlds, or essences or modal properties of this world) that make it true? Or should modal talk be understood as doing something other than attempting to describe features of the universe? And how can we come to acquire modal knowledge—given that we don’t seem to observe modal facts? This course will examine a range of positions in the metaphysics and epistemology of modality.","Two Philosophy courses, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,50.34,Experiencing Time,Kulvicki,,"Perplexity about the nature of time has evolved in lock step with worries about temporal experience. Somehow, we experience time passing, we differentiate now from later and before, and we do all of this while passing through time. Experience of time can be a window onto time itself, but that window might be muddy. Perhaps we fail to understand time because of how we experience it, or perhaps the best way to understand time is to attend to how we experience it.","Two Philosophy courses, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,50.35,"Mind, Language, and Morality",Plunkett and Phillips,COCO 031 COGS 11.03,"This course examines questions about the connection between mind, language, and normative domains such as morality, politics, and law. For example: how should we understand normative language that seems to be fundamentally about prescribing ways of acting, rather than about describing reality? Are moral judgments more a matter of emotion, or of belief? Can we reconcile a commitment to moral objectivity with our best scientific understanding of moral thought and talk? This course will engage such questions from a fundamentally interdisciplinary perspective, engaging with work from philosophy, cognitive science, linguistics, and psychology. In so doing, we will explore how empirical work can inform philosophical inquiry, and how philosophical inquiry can continue to guide ongoing research in the cognitive sciences. Students will be encouraged to work in interdisciplinary teams to create their own co-authored research.","Two Philosophy courses, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,50.36,Propaganda,Thomas,,"Communication pushes people around. Sentences, stories, pictures, graphs, and maps can all convey information. But they can also convince, enthrall, enrage, (dis)empower, and (de)humanize. This course focuses on how communicative acts and ideologies have this power. It considers some linguistic, political, epistemological, psychological, and aesthetic aspects of such acts. And it considers examples of the phenomenon as diverse as political ads, literature, film, painting, pornography, slurs, compliments and even course syllabi.","Two Philosophy courses, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,
PHIL,50.37,Self-Consciousness,Rosenkoetter,,"This seminar examines leading proposals for understanding self-consciousness, self-knowledge, and their significance in the philosophy of mind, philosophy of action, and theories of the self.  We will address questions such as these:  How are ‘I’-thoughts properly conceived?  Are they irreducible, or is there some way in which they can be explained in other terms?  In what sense, if any, are you directly acquainted with your own states of mind?  Is self-knowledge perceptual?  Is it constitutive of one’s status as a rational being?  How should our answers to these and related questions affect how we conceive of the self and its capacities?","Two Philosophy courses, or permission of the instructor.",TMV,

PHIL,80.01,Kant's Critique of Pure Reason,,,"A close study of this epoch-making work, which has set the agenda for many sub-fields of philosophy since its publication in 1781.  Kant observes that philosophy, in contrast to mathematics and natural science, cannot point to any results that are acknowledged by all able practitioners.  Thus, philosophy has made no progress.  Kant proposes a method and foundation for philosophy that will change that.",Requires the permission of the instructor.,TMV,
PHIL,80.05,Metametaphysics,,,"In this course, we will examine the nature and methods of metaphysics. Are ontological debates genuine debates, or do at least some of them involve pseudo-questions or merely terminological disputes? If they are genuine questions, how can we best find answers to them—or must the answers remain unknowable? Is there a privileged conceptual system for revealing the true ‘structure of reality’? We will address these and other questions, with texts from Carnap and Quine through to the present.",Requires the permission of the instructor.,TMV,

PHIL,80.12,"Free Will, Responsibility and the Brain",,,"Do we have free will? Does brain science show that we do or do not? How does moral responsibility depend on freedom? Can we be responsible if we are merely physical mechanisms? Can we blame people for their actions? This course will explore the philosophical questions and neuroscientific literature regarding free will, and will address the implications of this debate for law and society",Requires the permission of the instructor.,TMV,
PHIL,80.13,"Love, Respect, and Moral Obligation",,,"A survey of closely connected questions about the attitudes of love and respect, as well as the distinctive moral duties associated with each. Questions will include: What is distinctive about the attitudes of love and respect? Do we have universal duties of respect for all persons? If so, what do these duties entail for us? How is the partiality of an attitude like love to be reconciled with the impartiality of respect?",Requires the permission of the instructor.,TMV,
PHIL,80.14,"Kant on Being, Goodness, and Beauty",,,"This course will cover Kant’s accounts of what it is to judge of something that it is, that it is good, and that it is beautiful.  By far the most time will be devoted to the first of these accounts (his so-called theoretical philosophy), since it serves as a foundation for all of the rest.  Coverage of the latter two will focus on how all three accounts are unified in a single system of philosophy.",Requires the permission of the instructor.,TMV,
PHIL,80.15,Epistemic Normativity,,,"This seminar is on foundational issues in contemporary epistemology, focusing on questions about the nature and grounds of epistemic normativity. Possible topics include: the relationship between epistemic rationality and reasons for belief, whether or not epistemic justification is ultimately dependent on our psychologies or practical interests, the relationship between truth and epistemic justification, and the bearing of general metanormative theorizing on our understanding of normativity within epistemology.",Requires the permission of the instructor.,TMV,
PHIL,80.16,Plato's (Super)Naturalism,,,"Platonists, ancient and contemporary alike, commit themselves to the existence of abstract, nonphysical, intelligible beings (e.g. numbers, properties, propositions) in addition to concrete, spatiotemporal, perceptibles (e.g. horses, vases, mountains) . For Plato, in particular, changeless, intelligible beings are metaphysically and epistemologically prior to changing, perceptibles.  The supernatural is prior to the natural. We will attempt to reconstruct and to assess (a) Plato’s reasons for positing and privileging supernatural entities; (b) his view of how, if at all, the “two worlds” interact; (c) his view of how, if at all, we are to understand or to explain the natural in terms of the supernatural; and (d) the prospects for “natural science” as Plato understands them.",Requires the permission of the instructor.,TMV,

PHIL,80.18,Beauty,,,"Beauty is the preeminent aesthetic value, and plumbing its depths is one of philosophy's oldest occupations. Is beauty an objective feature of the world or merely ""in the eye of the beholder""? How do we judge something to be beautiful? What is the relationship between beauty and pleasure? Can art be beautiful? Can nature? What is the relationship between beauty and other values, like justice and virtue? Readings may include Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus, Augustine, Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, Hume, Kant, Schiller, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, G. E.

In this class we will work through some of Quine’s most influential papers and arguments, and will try to understand the underlying systematic commitments of his views.",Requires the permission of the instructor.,TMV,
PHIL,80.20,Controversies in Feminist Philosophy,,,"This seminar explores controversies in contemporary feminist philosophy over such issues as pornography and prostitution, sexual coercion and consent, the social construction of gender, and the intersections of gender with race, class, sexual orientation, disability, and other group-based identities. ",Requires the permission of the instructor.,TMV,
PHIL,80.21,Philosophical Methodology,,,"What does philosophical inquiry involve? What should it involve? What are the best ways to make progress in philosophy? Are the best methods for making progress in one area of philosophy (e.g. metaphysics) different from the best methods in another area (e.g. ethics)? Does the idea of philosophical progress even make sense? This course will address these and other questions about the nature of philosophy and philosophical methodology. Possible approaches to be discussed include conceptual analysis, philosophical naturalism, genealogy, ideology critique, phenomenology, thought experiments, and the a priori.",Requires the permission of the instructor.,TMV,
PHIL,80.22,Secondary Qualities,,,"Secondary qualities – colors, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches – raise important problems in the philosophy of mind, epistemology and metaphysics. For many reasons, they seem less objective, and more tied to experience, than the traditionally primary qualities like shapes and masses do. Would colors exist in a world without color perceivers? Would sounds exist without hearers? How do the problems with understanding color relate to those for taste, touch and smell? How are secondary qualities related to primary qualities? This course will consider both historical and contemporary attempts to grapple with the primary/secondary quality distinction.",Requires the permission of the instructor.,TMV,

PHIL,80.24,"The Real, the True, and the Vaguely",,,"What is truth? What conception of reality does truth involve? Should we think of truth or reality as transcending the limits of our evidence? Should we conceive of them as always tied to a perspective? Is truth an all-or-nothing matter, or might there be borderline cases? Could there be no definite fact of the matter about the way the world is? We’ll address such questions using historical and contemporary sources.",Requires the permission of the instructor.,TMV,
PHIL,80.25,Imagination,Thomas,,"The study of imagination has a long, rich philosophical history. Recently, there has been an explosion of interest in the topic. In this course, we will consider efforts to understand what imagination is and what role imagination plays in the cognitive and emotional lives of experiencers, inquirers, and agents. How is imagination related to perception, belief, pretense, supposition, and desire? What role does imagination play in emotions and in actions? How free is imagination? Can we imagine the impossible? What do we learn about imagination by considering how we engage (or are resistant to engage) in fictional imaginings? How do imagination and creativity interact? Can we rely on imagination to learn or to come to know something new? If so, how? If not, why not? Readings will be drawn from both historical and contemporary sources.",Requires the permission of the instructor.,TMV,
PHIL,80.26,Conceptual Ethics and Conceptual Engineering,Thomasson,,"Some have argued that a central and legitimate job of philosophy involves conceptual ethics and conceptual engineering: that is, work in determining what sorts of language or concepts we should use, and how we should use them. In this course we will examine the motivations for thinking of philosophy in this way. We will go on to consider questions such as: How is conceptual engineering possible, and how could it lead to philosophical progress? To what extent can past philosophical debates be reconceived as involved in conceptual negotiation? What are the signs that conceptual (re-)engineering is needed? How can and should this sort of work be done? What view(s) of concepts are involved in undertaking this work—and is it better to think of this work at the conceptual or linguistic level? What criteria can and should we employ in evaluating concepts, or conceptual systems? Is conceptual engineering even possible—and if so, how can we do it?",Requires the permission of the instructor.,TMV,

PHIL,80.28,"Reasons, Value, and Well-Being",,,"Many otherwise divergent moral theories agree that we have reason to create and sustain value (or “the good”).  How should we understand the concept that plays this central role in ethics?  Might there actually be two different concepts that are often called by the same name?  We face many questions about which sorts of things (pleasure, knowledge, virtue, and beauty) have intrinsic or final value.  Well-being plays a central role in theories of value.  What is well-being?  And what distinguishes it from ‘impersonal’ values, if there are any?",Requires the permission of the instructor.,TMV,
PHIL,80.29,The Ethics of Neuroscience,,,"This course delves deeply into some of the main questions in neuroethics.

This course will address this question, which is known as ‘the problem of other minds.’ We will tackle ‘the problem of other minds’ from multiple angles, relying heavily on neuroscience and psychology research, as well as a few foundational papers from philosophy. Specifically, we will address questions such as: Do specialized portions of the brain accomplish mental state inference? When do mind-reading skills develop in children and are humans the only species that can represent other minds? Why do some people, such as individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), experience difficulties in understanding others?

PSYC,86.05,Future Directions in Psychological Science,Wheatley,,"Psychology and neuroscience are ever evolving. Textbooks, with their hundreds of pages, are continually edited, making way for new areas of research previously unstudied. What is on the horizon for these fields? In this culminating seminar, we will look at the ways these fields are breaking new ground in deepening our knowledge of the human mind, the research that foreshadowed those changes, and the role of interdisciplinarity. We will also discuss the implications of these new directions in terms of how we grapple with the deepest psychological questions – What does it mean to be human? How should we treat others? How do minds connect? And how should science, itself, change to become more robust, open and objective? Throughout the class, we will discuss the important and challenging ethical implications of these new frontiers.",PSYC 1 and instructor permission via the department website,,

QSS,30.12,Quantitative Literary Criticism,,CLST 10.09,"Digitization of vast numbers of texts and rapid advances in computational methods are enabling new forms of criticism in all areas of literary study. Classics was an early adopter of digital technologies, and computation is now pervasive throughout the field, as illustrated by flagship projects such as the Perseus Digital Library. Beyond the familiar examples of digitized texts and simple word searches, scholars and students also benefit from an ever-growing array of sophisticated quantitative tools, and from increasing engagement with diverse technical disciplines – natural language processing, data science, even bioinformatics. Through a survey of recent research at the intersection of Latin literature and the digital humanities, this course will introduce you to the state of the art in quantitative literary criticism. To ground our methodological investigations, we will explore a diverse selection of Latin poetry, including epic (Vergil, Lucan, and Catullus), elegy (Catullus), and comedy (Plautus), and sample some less famous later authors, such as Paul the Deacon and Vitalis of Blois, who were influenced by classical antecedents. At each turn, we will examine the interplay between traditional (close reading, philology, theory) and data-driven analyses of Latin literature and consider how quantitative methods can support humanistic inquiry. Along the way, you will gain hands-on experience with powerful computational tools and be introduced to now ubiquitous critical approaches, such as intertextuality and reception studies. Assigned readings will be in English translation using bilingual Latin-English editions; in addition to reading all of the English, students with Latin will be responsible for understanding and translating “micro samples” of the original texts. The course assumes no prior computational background.",,TAS,

QSS,30.19,Data and Bodies,,,"In this course we will take a multi-modal approach to understanding relationships between “datafication” and human bodies. Today’s “Datafication” is a process of transforming diverse processes, qualities, actions and phenomena into forms that are machine-readable by digital technologies, but the act of turning humans and human bodies into quanta of information has a long history. We will be using art, new media, history, information science, and more to think through the impact that datafication has on how we understand ourselves and others. Particular attention will be paid to the ways in which data has historically been used in racializing and gendering ways, and the role that quantification of people has been integral to the development of the Western nation-state.",,SOC,
QSS,30.20,"Polling, Public Opinion, and Public Policy",Barabas,GOVT 037 PBPL 044,"The results of public opinion polls frequently dominate political news coverage and they often alter the behavior of politicians; moreover, political polls have started becoming news in their own right in recent years.  In this course, we will explore the techniques that pollsters use to examine public attitudes and we will consider how that information can, and should, be used to formulate public policy.  We will engage questions such as: To what degree can the public form meaningful preferences about complex political issues?  What does a political opinion consist of, and how can it be measured?  How can potential errors in polls be avoided?  How does partisanship influence public opinion, and where do Americans stand on key policy issues?  To what extent should politicians try to change public opinion rather than respond to it?  How has the nature and role of public opinion shifted in an era of rapidly advancing polling technology and a changing media environment?  In addition to examining the pertinent literature on topics such as these, we will conduct and analyze an actual public opinion survey as a class.  Through a combination of theoretical and hands-on learning, students will leave the course with a firm understanding of these dynamics.",,SOC; WCult:W,
QSS,30.21,Social Justice and Computing,,,"This course draws on feminist and queer scholarship to examine the intricate relationship between datafication, ubiquitous computing, and social justice, highlighting the politics and impacts of data-driven processes and big data on human lives. One of the key highlights of WGSS engagements with computing history is the focus on the politics and impacts of data-driven processes and big data on human lives. The course will provide a brief introduction to histories of computing and data-driven practices within the Anglo-American tradition, including discussions of the roles that ethics and biopolitics play within these histories. We will explore ways that privacy/security, algorithmic processes, computational environmental impacts, and design have exploited the most vulnerable while increasing affordances for the most privileged. We will also spend significant time learning about new data/computational justice initiatives and develop a robust understanding of how social justice issues like prison abolition, climate change, and equitable health outcomes are at the core of understanding computational cultures. No Computer Science or Data Science background is required, but the course will entail learning about some of the technical history within both fields.

PBPL,27,Affirmative Action in Higher Education,Herman,GOVT 30.12,"Since John F. Kennedy’s 1961 executive order to implement affirmative action policies, institutions of higher education have looked for ways to encourage minority and low-income students to matriculate. Some institutions, such as such as Harvard, UC Berkeley, UT Austin, and UMichigan, have experienced lawsuits against the policy’s implementation. As universities stress their desire for diverse, well-rounded, high achieving classes and continue to implement methods to attract highly qualified students, there is disagreement about which methods are both effective and fair. How can educational administrators, parents and community members work together to improve college access and increase equality? Do we still need to “take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are…treated…without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,"" or has affirmative action outlived its original purpose? Has the college access gap widened or shrunk? Are students’ experiences on campus living up to the goal of equal opportunity? This course will explore the topic of affirmative action through some traditional classroom techniques (reading/ writing/ discussion) as well as experiential education techniques (such as creating a public policy portfolio project, having conversations with professionals who administer affirmative action at colleges and universities, and pitching proposals to a panel of policy experts).
\fThe central work of the course involves creating a portfolio of venues to explore, design, publicize, and promote an affirmative action or anti-discrimination policy/program. Completing the course readings and discussions will develop the skills necessary to complete the portfolio. Throughout the course, students will work in small groups to develop a policy campaign using techniques from writing to video to speeches. This course design attempts to raise students’ awareness of the multiple communication modes for making a compelling and persuasive policy proposal. To create their portfolios, students must advance an issue, demonstrate the techniques they have used to study and develop it, and effectively persuade their audience of the policy/program’s value. Student groups will meet with the professors biweekly or more frequently (as needed) to stay on track and to get help with process and resources.

Religion is understood to direct the individual to the contemplation of the divine and provide a moral code; sex and sexuality is often perceived as too human and too tied to pleasure to have anything to do with the divine. But if we examine the relationship between sexuality and religion, we find that the two are inextricably intertwined. Indeed, the understanding of humans as sexed beings (that is, with differing sexual identities and as beings who engage in sex) is often grounded in religious texts, practices, and ideologies. Yet that religious grounding, while seemingly so solid, proves surprisingly flexible in practice. We will examine comparatively the ways in which religious stories, beliefs, and practices have shaped across several traditions.

In this course, we study the efforts of a range of ancient authors to think through these problems in a way that seemed intellectually satisfying.

Beyond considering the commonalities and distinctions in form and practice that characterize various African diasporic religious practices, participants will also work to understand the constructions of race and belonging, ethnic identity, gender, sexuality, class, and geographic location that affect the lives of black religious adherents.",,INT or TMV; WCult:CI,

Russia is a continental power of vast proportions whose traditions, character, national myths, and forms of political organization often seem a mirror-image to those of the United States. After a brief survey of Russian history, the course will examine certain determinants of Russian culture, including Christianity, multinationalism, and the status of Russian civilization on the periphery of Europe.

RUSS,11.03,How the Hammer and Sickle Gave Way to McDonalds,,,"We will explore a wide variety of domestic and foreign media including film, music, jokes, detective novels, and streaming online videos across the Soviet period and into the present time. Artistic disciplines during the Soviet period were firmly entrenched within cultural industries that featured union memberships, the means to control production, distribution, and exhibition. Nonetheless, what was popular throughout Russo-Soviet history did not always emanate from state guided channels. How do we account for what we perceive as “anomalies” in Russian popular culture: why did people listen to American jazz music under Stalin? Why were Bollywood films more popular than Soviet comedies? Why were Brazilian and Mexican telenovelas standard viewing in Soviet homes? How did the presence of foreign texts relate to the multi-ethnic makeup on the Soviet Union? How were founding mythologies of the nation encoded/rejected in domestic texts?   While popular culture encompasses a multitude of media, special attention will be paid to trends in music and cinema, offering students a comprehensive, historical arc of each medium’s development in Russia. The course will seek to establish a working definition of what we actually mean by “Russian popular culture.” Firstly, how do we differentiate between categorizations of mass culture versus popular culture? Secondly, we will challenge the notion of national culture when referring to the terms “Russian” and “Soviet” culture throughout the semester. Each unit is organized around the construct of “svoi” (“ours”) vs. “chuzhoi” (“theirs”), offering the class a point of comparison for how domestically produced culture often rivaled official foreign imports and blackmarket, unofficial distributed products. We will also explore larger, universal questions that revolve around top-bottom and bottom-up models of how popular culture operates. What does popular culture mean in the capitalist market context, and how might that definition change under socialism?",,INT or SOC; WCult:W,

As we move from the familiar genre of the riddle to the often mystifying beliefs and rituals of the ancient Slavs and then to the fairy tale, comfortingly familiar from childhood, we will learn to not only recognize the richness and density of texts that may initially seem uncomplicated but also to discern the patterns and meanings behind the apparently exotic narratives and behaviors. By thoroughly studying one of the world's richest oral traditions, Slavic folk life and folklore, we will acquire the tools and techniques necessary for collecting, documenting, and interpreting folklore -- which is perhaps the most truly international of all arts. The course is based on materials in Russian and East European cultures, but also draws from other traditions. Open to all classes.",,INT or LIT; WCult:W,

The course also touches upon Eastern/Central European film, including the Czech New Wave (surrealist animator Jan Svankmeyer) and the ""post-Yugoslavian wave"" (Emir Kusturica and Dusan Makoveev). In addition to regular weekly screenings, all films will be made available online in an experimental format: divided into separate short clips that will be used in class for in-depth analysis and close cinematic readings.

This course will examine those areas in the study of culture and of language pragmatics with relevance to such communication between American and Russians. Readings and class discussions will focus on such phenomena as 'culture' and 'language' shock; the linguistics and cultural evidence for differences in the two countries' views of such phenomena as time and space, as well as for such concepts as public and private 'spheres,' friendship, or of what constitutes a conversation.

RUSS,31,The World as Word: 19th Century Russian Fiction,Somoff,,"In his Philosophical Letters, Pyotr Chaadaev, a 19th century Russian intellectual, compared Russian history to the history of Western civilization. Chaadaev proclaimed that Russia had been cut off from the global community, belonged to no cultural system, and contributed nothing to the progress of the human spirit. Since then, Russian writers and thinkers have wrestled with Chaadaev’s categorical verdict. One response from the 20th century poet Osip Mandelstam pointed out that Chaadaev had overlooked one singular contribution: the Russian language. “Such a highly organized, such an organic language is not merely a door into history, it is history itself.” Taking Mandelstam’s point to its logical conclusion, it is Russia’s literature that becomes the Rosetta stone to the exceptional nature of the Russian experience. In this course, we will explore some of the texts that make up this Rosetta stone. While reading some of the most celebrated works from 19th century Russian fiction – texts by Pushkin, Lermontov, Gogol, Turgenev, Goncharov, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Chekhov – we will attempt to account for the distinct character of Russian literature and its unique role in Russian history and culture.",,LIT; WCult:W,

As we read and discuss novels, stories, poems, and plays written by the Russian writers of that time, we will consider the correlations and tensions between the Russian sociohistorical reality and artistic expression. In addition to readings from literary and historical sources, we will watch films created by some of the most celebrated Russian filmmakers as a well as the recent controversial documentary The Soviet Story produced by Latvian director Edvins Snore.",,LIT; WCult:W,

Beginning with the collapse of the USSR, cultural life in Russia has been characterized by ceaseless change, but also the reemergence of old patterns, tendencies and problems. Much contemporary Russian literature and art is caught up in complicated negotiations with the Soviet past and its social, cultural and political institutions, while also looking ahead to an uncertain future. We will read novels, short stories, plays and poetry, watch films and discuss visual and performance art with a view to topics ranging from gender and sex, activism and violence, family and national identity, internet communication and other language problems. ",,LIT; WCult:W,
RUSS,35,Dostoevsky and the Problem of Evil,Patyk,,"Dostoevsky laid bare the tragedy of human existence and probed the innermost recesses of the human psyche to show the terrifying isolation of a human being separated from God. Revolted by a world in which innocent children suffer, Dostoevsky tested the meaning to be found in Christianity, personal responsibility and human solidarity. This course examines his major novels, with particular emphasis on the artistic expression of his philosophical views.

RUSS,36,The Seer of the Flesh&quot;: Tolstoy's Art and Thought,Gronas,,"From childhood to the end of his life, Tolstoy struggled to overcome his fear of death. As he himself put the problem, ‘Is there any meaning in my life which the inevitable death awaiting me does not destroy?’ In his quest for bulwarks against that fear, he studied the great philosophers and he examined closely the value system of the peasants. He found temporary relief in war and in marriage, but the definitive solution always eluded him. The evolution of this theme, and the formal devices by which Tolstoy expressed it in his prose, will be traced in the major novels, War and Peace and Anna Karenina. The course will conclude with a brief examination of the prose that Tolstoy produced after his conversion. Taught in English. Open to all classes.",,LIT; WCult:W,

RUSS,38.09,Creative Writing in Russian: Russian and Ukrainian Short Story,Somoff,,"This class is conducted in the format of a workshop and provides learners and speakers of Russian with an opportunity to engage in creative writing in Russian. We will read selected Russian, Ukrainian (and other) literary texts and examine them from the perspective of a writer rather than a reader or a critic. We will also explore semantic, stylistic, and poetic resources of language through a variety of experimental assignments. Finally, each student will undertake their own creative writing project, which will center on a specific literary genre and a specific topic chosen as the cultural-historical focus for the course. For the Fall of 2017, this topic will be the 1960s-70s in Ukraine, which, at that time, was part of the Soviet Union. Each student will write one short story, set in 1960-70s Ukraine, and written from the perspective of an imaginary, yet historically grounded, narrator. The reading list for the course will include some of the best short stories written in the Russian and the Ukrainian languages as well as collateral texts and films of various genres devoted primarily to the 1960s-70s in Ukraine and the Soviet Union.

In this course, we will investigate two national conspiracist traditions, the American and the Russian, and the parallel rise and stunning convergence of Russian and American conspiracism in our current political moment. In order to do so, we will inquire into the historical origins, the form, function, and effectiveness of conspiracist narratives in these two traditions in the 20th and 21st centuries. Ultimately we will approach conspiracy theories as ways of knowing, of penetrating and ordering complex and opaque realities. They are also powerful narrative weapons that imperil the shared truths on which cohesive societies are based. Our course texts include The Master and Margarita (Bulgakov), The Crucible (Miller), and Libra (DeLillo), Ivan the Terrible Part II (Eisenstein) The Manchurian Candidate (Frankenheimer) and The Matrix (The Wachkowskis) as well as literary and cultural studies of conspiracist narrative and ideation.",,INT or TMV; WCult:W,

SOCY,20,"Sex, Death, and Migration – Or How We Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the (Population) Bomb",Sharp,,"The world’s population will more than double from 7 to 16 billion by 2100. In addition, some countries’ populations are booming whereas others face rapid decline. What does this mean for public policy, population health and aging, fertility and reproductive health, immigration and social inequality? To gain insight into these questions, social scientists study some of life’s most intimate moments – sex, illness and death, and moving from home to home. These components of population change (mortality, fertility, and migration) help us better understand the impact of population composition and change. In this class, we will first learn the basic tools that social scientists use to analyze broad population trends. We will then use these tools to gain insight into population patterns across the globe. At the end of the course, students will apply what they learned to the analysis of the population trends of a country of their choice, as well as compare and contrast population trends across different countries.",,INT or SOC,

Among the views to be considered are modernization, which assumes that later developing countries will follow paths once traveled by today's advanced countries; and dependency and world system theories, which view the integration of less developed countries into the world market as problematic and, under certain conditions, even disadvantageous. We will test these theories by applying them to specific cases. A major part of the course will focus on the economic 'miracle' of East Asian countries, as well as cases that have not been so successful.

Diverse sciences have established that human beings are well over 99% genetically identical, but race remains a potent vision through division that has been made and made to matter across multiple spheres of life.

A sociological approach to the body and embodiment provides an opportunity to bridge the gap between everyday experience and analyses of broad social structures which can seem disconnected from daily life. In this course, we will examine the processes by which individual bodies are shaped by and, in turn, shape social life. Key questions to be explored include: how are bodies regulated by social forces; how do individuals perform the body and how does interactional context influence this performance; what is the meaning of the body in social life; and is there a ""right"" body?",,SOC,

This course begins with the medieval Islamicate Empires — Mughal, Safavid, and Ottoman — and then moves through the end of empire, the colonial era, the establishment of the nation state, and the emergence of modern cultural, political, and religious movements. In doing so, we will situate the histories and social worlds of the region in a global frame, asking how global political and economic transformations have affected the region. At the same time that we attend closely to these histories, we will also examine the ways in which the category of “woman” has been mobilized in popular and political discourses in the 18th-21th centuries, paying particular attention to how Muslim and Middle Eastern women have been represented in various political discourses, as well as how they have represented themselves. Through close readings of both primary sources (in translation) and secondary literature — including historiographical, theoretical, and literary texts as well as film and music— we will also tackle the questions, controversies, and stereotypes that have animated debates in both scholarly and popular literature on such topics as the veil, feminism, revolution, human rights, LGBT issues, masculinity, and war.",,SOC; WCult:NW,

Each week, students will examine a performance at the limit of action, including passivity, silence, and endurance, alongside issues related to gender, sexuality, labor, and immigration among others. How might we approach and reconcile with performances that once again reify notions of racialized and gendered bodies as apolitical, passive, submissive, and compliant? Drawing on scholarship within black and women of color feminist criticism, queer theory, critical ethnic studies, Asian American Studies, and performance studies, this course will attune students to the role of aesthetics to interrogate and expand what we typically conceive of as activism, resistance, and survival from racialized, feminized, and queer positions.",,ART; WCult:CI,

Traversing 20th and 21st century cultural production, each week will be organized around artists and writers who actively engage the concept of memory as a political act against the denial or disavowal of violence. We set out to understand the social, political, and economic contexts in which artists create their work, addressing issues of race, gender, sexuality, nation, class, ability, and environmental decay.

This course begins with genealogies of global, women of color, and postcolonial or Third World feminisms and histories of movement-building from which transnational feminism emerged. Students will be introduced to themes of universalism, solidarity, positionality, and the problems with  speaking for “others,” especially Northern feminists representing women in the Global South.

How might both terms require us to rethink what narratives of belonging look, feel, and sound like and in turn, become the grounds for alternative solidarities, affiliations, and intimacies across lines of minority difference? To answer these questions, we will engage with primarily contemporary Asian/American works of literature, poetry, film, performance, and art that alters, disrupts, and varies Asian/American narratives of migration, assimilation, and upward mobility.

Moreover, proponents of sexual science in Europe and North America adopted notions forged in exchange with actors in Asia, Latin America and Africa, e.g., the US practice of gender reassignment surgery was heavily influenced by earlier Mexican cases or the German legal understanding of homosexuality was tested and contested in its colonial African courts.  We will study many figures who have been forgotten in contemporary work on sexuality or sexual science.  Some of these figures drew from the repressive legal, social and cultural discourses that limited sexual expression and gave the ideological grounds to discrimination and persecution.  But others—and they were at times the very same figures—connected to the liberating discourses, the power of which we are experiencing today.",,INT or SOC; WCult:NW,

Such connections have long been recognized, but recent research from diverse fields like linguistics, (ethno)musicology, cognitive psychology, anthropology, and neuroscience continues to reveal just how intertwined the two faculties are. Drawing on this body of research and our respective specialties, we explore the language-music connection from the basic ingredients (pitch, timbre, rhythm, syntax), to cultural expression, to evolution and origins. Running through the course is a hands-on case study of a West African xylophone tradition where language and music are so intimately related that they cannot be separated.

The course will then critically examine various barriers that women may face in the pursuit of elected office in the U.S., and we will also expand our view beyond politics, by analyzing women in non-political leadership positions in order to draw useful comparisons.

It will begin with the evolution of market relations from the peculiar history of seventeenth-century Britain. It will then look at the succession of thinkers who, having embraced the novel scientific methods of the day, sought to understand economic affairs as themselves governed by scientific laws; and who then sought to ground the legitimacy of commonwealths in laws, regulations and interventions that engendered wealth. One goal of the course is to familiarize students with foundational thinkers who gave us the discipline of economics: Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Smith, Ricardo, Marx, Mill, and Spencer.

Topics will include theories concerning the clash of civilizations, the rise of fundamentalist political movements, liberation theologies, religion and violence, the relationship of religions to the State, and the religious dimensions of political movements.

This course introduces students to various aspects of this role and the reactions it triggered. It covers the role played by American missionaries and travelers/immigrants around the turn of the 20th century. It analyzes the transformative impact of the discovery of Oil, the establishment of the state of Israel, the Cold War, Turkey’s integration into NATO and the US attempts to establish a security regime for the Middle East. It also examines how Americans viewed the Middle East and their role in its life. In addition, the course then takes the students in a tour d’horizon of US role in Middle East politics: its involvement in the Arab-Israeli Peace Process, its responses to Radical Islamism and 9/11, the invasion of Iraq and its consequences, the uneasy relationship with a changing Turkey, and its policy of “democracy promotion”.

What is the best way of thinking about this transformation in the prominence of the market in human life?

GOVT,30.10,American Conservatism,Latimer,,"In 1950, Lionel Trilling characterized conservatism as a collection of “irritable mental gestures that seek to resemble ideas.”  He was wrong; this course shows why. If American liberalism is primarily concerned with equality, conservatism places greater emphasis on religion, tradition, community, virtue, authority, and (in certain respects) liberty.

GOVT,30.12,Affirmative Action in Higher Education,Herman,PBPL 027,"Since John F. Kennedy’s 1961 executive order to implement affirmative action policies, institutions of higher education have looked for ways to encourage minority and low-income students to matriculate. Some institutions, such as such as Harvard, UC Berkeley, UT Austin, and UMichigan, have experienced lawsuits against the policy’s implementation. As universities stress their desire for diverse, well-rounded, high achieving classes and continue to implement methods to attract highly qualified students, there is disagreement about which methods are both effective and fair. How can educational administrators, parents and community members work together to improve college access and increase equality? Do we still need to “take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are…treated…without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,"" or has affirmative action outlived its original purpose? Has the college access gap widened or shrunk? Are students’ experiences on campus living up to the goal of equal opportunity? This course will explore the topic of affirmative action through some traditional classroom techniques (reading/ writing/ discussion) as well as experiential education techniques (such as creating a public policy portfolio project, having conversations with professionals who administer affirmative action at colleges and universities, and pitching proposals to a panel of policy experts).
\fThe central work of the course involves creating a portfolio of venues to explore, design, publicize, and promote an affirmative action or anti-discrimination policy/program. Completing the course readings and discussions will develop the skills necessary to complete the portfolio. Throughout the course, students will work in small groups to develop a policy campaign using techniques from writing to video to speeches. This course design attempts to raise students’ awareness of the multiple communication modes for making a compelling and persuasive policy proposal. To create their portfolios, students must advance an issue, demonstrate the techniques they have used to study and develop it, and effectively persuade their audience of the policy/program’s value. Student groups will meet with the professors biweekly or more frequently (as needed) to stay on track and to get help with process and resources.

Before every dictator is a population that is willing to accept rule by the dictator. The dictator cannot impose his will on a people that shun a dictatorship. Extrapolating from this concept, we can consider dictatorship to be a syndrome.

We begin with an examination of the regional balance of power: what is power, who has it, and how is the balance of power shifting? We then focus on the military relations between key countries, assessing the conventional and nuclear balance of power, and the prospects for stable deterrence. We next move to the realm of ideas, where we explore how history and national identities affect the security strategies of states, and how they affect regional relations. We will then consider the prospects for a “liberal peace” in the region, made possible through increasing economic interdependence and through democratization. The course incorporates a crisis simulation in which students are tasked with representing a country in a significant multinational regional dispute.  ",,INT or SOC; WCult:NW,

What explains why resistance is widespread in some historical cases and relatively weak in others? Why do some resistance movements succeed whereas others fail? How should we understand the dynamics of insurgency and counterinsurgency in countries under foreign occupation? Finally, what are the long-term consequences of resistance and collaboration, and how are these phenomena remembered in countries that once suffered under occupation?

GOVT,85.41,Political Violence,Lyall,,"This seminar surveys the causes, effects, and consequences of political violence across several empirical domains, including civil war, interstate war, insurgency, coups, rebellions, and organized crime. Given the explosion of research on political violence over the past decade, the course is not (and cannot be) a comprehensive review of the literature. In truth, each of the weekly topics could be the subject of its own dedicated course. Instead, the seminar offers a curated view of some of the core works in the field as well as emerging research areas. Particular attention is paid to recent scholarship (mostly within the past five years) to identify conceptual, theoretical, or empirical gaps in existing studies that might inspire your own research efforts. The course is deliberately interdisciplinary: we draw on political science, behavioral economics, social psychology, history, and anthropology, along with some research in natural sciences. It also bridges the disciplinary divide separating comparative politics and international relations by drawing on both civil and interstate wars, as well as violence at lower levels of intensity and scale. Selected readings also span multiple levels of analysis, ranging from sweeping cross-national comparisons across hundreds of years of history to subnational within-country comparisons to organizational and individual-level approaches. Equal weight is given to theory and research design when discussing these readings.

No period of English literature is so deeply and even obsessively concerned with both politics and religion.

We will also take time for some comedies typical of the period by William Wycherly and William Congreve, and study Aphra Behn’s masterpiece, Oroonoko. There will be two areas of special attention:  the theater and the literary responses to public events, such as the Great Plague and Fire of 1666, the Popish Plot, and the Exclusion Crisis.",,LIT; WCult:W,

This course will trace the fortunes of writers such as Samuel Johnson, James Boswell, Oliver Goldsmith, and Edmund Burke as they grapple with the anxieties of their time.

ENGL,23,Romantic Literature: Aesthetics and Ideology from the French Revolution to Frankenstein,Garrison,,"The modern conception of the imagination as a force for radical social change emerged, in large part, thanks to the aesthetic innovations of Romantic writers working in the wake of the French Revolution. At the same time, however, the prospect of revolutionary violence made the imagination a dangerous, and intensely debated faculty, as promising as it was potentially pathological, and as likely to produce a Gothic nightmare as a pastoral utopia. This course will examine the richly varied forms of literary and political experience that emerge out of this moment, and that continue to shape modern conceptions of creativity, sexuality, ecology and social transformation. Readings include works by William Blake, William Wordsworth, Percy and Mary Shelley, John Keats, and Thomas de Quincey.",,LIT; WCult:W,

ENGL,26,Masterpieces of Nineteenth Century British Fiction,,,"The British novel achieved great popularity during the nineteenth century as it became a realist form with increasing complexities of plot and character. During a period of imperial and economic expansion, too, great works of fiction participated in widespread debates about progress, empire, Englishness, and evolutionary thought. We will look at fiction's contributions to such cultural debates, considering the novel's powerful critique of empire and dreams of progress; the importance of formations of English identity to plot and character; reactions in fiction to evolutionary revisions of history; and how Victorian fiction signals the importance of class, gender, and race to character development. Readings may include Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre, Charles DIckens's Great Expectations, Wilkie Collins's The Moonstone, George Eliot’s Middlemarch, Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles, and Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray.",,LIT; WCult:W,

The course is designed to provide an overview of the literary history of the United States novel from the National Period to the threshold of the Modern (1845-1900). To do justice to the range of works under discussion, the lectures will call attention to the heterogeneous cultural contexts out of which these works have emerged as well as the formal and structural components of the different works under discussion. In keeping with this intention, the lectures include the so-called classic texts in American literature, The Last of the Mohicans, Moby Dick, The Scarlet Letter, and The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, but also the newly canonized Uncle Tom's Cabin, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Life in the Iron Mills, and Hope Leslie.  The configuration of these works will result in an understanding of the remarkable complexity of United States literary culture.",,LIT; WCult:W,

ENGL,36,Contemporary American Fiction,Stuelke,,"Contemporary American fiction introduces the reader to the unexpected. Instead of conventionally structured stories, stereotypical heroes, traditional value systems, and familiar uses of language, the reader finds new and diverse narrative forms. Such writers as Toni Morrison, Thomas Pynchon, Maxine Hong Kingston, Leslie Silko, Norman Mailer, Don DeLillo, and Ralph Ellison, among others, have produced a body of important, innovative fiction expressive of a modern American literary sensibility. The course requires intensive class reading of this fiction and varied critical writing on postmodernism.",,LIT; WCult:W,

ENGL,44,Introduction to Digital Studies,Evens,,"This course introduces digital studies, the scholarly engagement with digital technologies and the cultures that have risen alongside them. It is a commonplace to note that the digital is pervasive in our lives, and it therefore plays at least some role in almost every human activity, from the mundane to the exotic. This course will chart the development of the digital from its growth in the twentieth century to its current hegemony, and will consider its relationship to communication, sociality, identity, media, arts, recreation, politics, the future, and more.

ENGL,48,Critical Issues in Postcolonial Studies,Khan,,"This course charts one genealogy of postcolonial theory as it developed in the Anglo-American academy in the 1980s. Drawing on the two internationalist traditions of the late nineteenth and twentieth century, Marxism and Psychoanalysis, this course examines the ways in which these two theoretical frameworks helped construct postcolonial thinking while at the same time becoming the sites of its most rigorous critique. The course will begin with an introduction to some of the key concepts in Marxist and psychoanalytic thought, specifically as these two traditions understand colonialism. Then, we will read the work of postcolonial thinkers, such as Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, Gayatri Spivak, and Homi Bhabha, to consider their critiques of colonial thought and practices. Throughout the course, we will attend to the way in which racial and sexual difference is considered in the readings.

CRWT,40.01,Imaginary Countries,Chee,," This course introduces the techniques used in speculative fiction—literary novels and stories using either science fiction, magical realism, or myth, or a mix of these, so the author can reinvent a country’s history, the country itself—even the world. We will read for technique, and discuss the effects these fictions achieve with their structures and the narrative and aesthetic strategies deployed. Students will write and workshop two stories. Readings may include: Virginia Woolf's Orlando, Andrew Sean Greer’s “Darkness”, Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go, Chris Adrian’s “Every Night For A Thousand Years”, Anne Carson’s Autobiography of Red, Yiyun Li’s “Immortality”, Jan Morris’ Hav, Toni Morrison’s Sula, and Carmen Machado’s “The Husband Stitch.”",,ART,

CRWT,40.03,Raising the Dead,,,"How can we practice ""immersion journalism,"" as creative nonfiction is sometimes described, when writing about people and events of the past? In this creative nonfiction writing course, we'll immerse ourselves in the kind of research that will allow us to recreate moments and moods for which we couldn't be present. We'll become witnesses at a remove; and, through careful attention to our own roles in the construction of our stories, participant-observers, as well. We'll learn how to use archives; make creative use of documents and artifacts; engage with scholarly historical writing as a source for creative writing; and interrogate our assumptions about research and representation, all in the service of character-driven narratives as vivid, nuanced, and dramatic as writing based on contemporary fieldwork. This course is an attempt to raise the dead, to resurrect truths from dormant facts, to find stories of the present within the past. You'll write two short nonfiction stories, of a person and a place, based on secondary sources, and one long narrative based on original research. The texts we'll be reading, by Lauren Redniss, John D'Agata, Svetlana Alexievitch, Joe Sacco, Maggie Nelson, and Michael Lesy, among others, vary radically in form and medium, as may your own experimental nonfictions",,ART,

Van Jordan (The Cineaste) and Dee Matthews (Simulacra), and based on these readings they will develop their own creative work in hybrid genres. The class will utilize both seminar and workshop formats, but the emphasis will be on the practice of writing as a way of thinking through forms of social, political and cultural engagement with this anxious moment in history, and of asking what kind of parameters, if any, art, particularly literature, truly requires? Are they porous enough? And what role does identity play in the choice to cross such borders?",,ART,

Are they merely reactions to damaging contemporary trends or richly imaginative, fully realized conceptions of what is to come? Via intensive reading, discussion of work in the genre in combination with contemporary essays, newspaper accounts, film and documentary, we will consider the power of fiction to shape and draw attention to the dilemmas that face humankind in the 21st century and beyond. We will touch upon and reference those earlier works that have shaped the genre, such as We by Yevgeny Zamyatin, Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World and 1984 by George Orwell, but our primary focus will be on those fictions of the last forty years that ring prophetically and frighteningly true vis-à-vis events in our current world. We’ll be reading a wide variety of authors, which may include, Harlan Ellison, Philip K. Dick, Cormac McCarthy, J.G. Ballard, John Wyndham, Richard Matheson, and Anthony Burgess.

CRWT,40.09,Obsessive Affinities Contemporary French & American poetry,Elhariry,COLT 31.02 FRIT 37.08,"This deeply experiential course examines the rich history of transatlantic desire, negotiated over the love of poetry. The United States has always figured heavily in the collective French imaginary ever since the American Revolution, for instance in the works of Tocqueville and Chateaubriand. American literature, however, gains particular prominence toward the mid-twentieth century with the transatlantic travels of Simone de Beauvoir, André Breton, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Philippe Sollers among authors, to the point that French writers began wondering how one can even be French in the first place. The course explores this crisis in national identity through a series of important poetic Franco-American friendships and collaborations: Edmond Jabès and Rosmarie Waldrop; Emmanuel Hocquard and Michael Palmer; Serge Pey and Allen Ginsberg; the Fondation Royaumont; the poetry collective double change; among others.",,LIT; WCult:W,
CRWT,40.10,James Joyce’s Ulysses,,,"This is a class for creative writers and creative readers interested in studying, and more importantly enjoying, James Joyce, the storyteller. No previous experience with Joyce is required. Though the class will begin with an intensive examination of Joyce’s seminal long story, “The Dead,” our focus during the term will be an intensive, close reading of his second novel, Ulysses, a book that, generally speaking, is more famous than actually read. A colossal influence on generations of writers, and readers, including T.S. Eliot, Derek Wolcott, Edna O’Brien and countless others, Ulysses is, among many other things, challenging, irreverent, thought-provoking, political, technically virtuosic, and above all wildly entertaining. Students will read some outside sources on Joyce but for the most part our primary text will be Joyce’s own words – wherever they lead us. Prepare to meet a fascinating and chaotic cast of characters featuring – Lilly, Kate and Julia Morkan, Gabriel Conroy, Stephan Dedalus, Leopold and Molly Bloom, and many others. Assignments will include critical and creative responses to both “The Dead” and Ulysses, as well as a final essay.",,LIT; WCult:W,
CRWT,40.11,Nature Writing,Bennett,,"This writing workshop provides an interdisciplinary exploration of literary works operating within the realm of Black environmental thought. Following Ed Roberson’s claim that “the world does not run the earth, but the earth does run the world” we will linger with the writings of those who have been forced to theorize from the underside of modernity, those who view black literary studies not only as an institutional enterprise, but as planetary thinking, as a commitment to care for the earth. Together, we will think critically about what it means to write at the intersection of race and environment in a social and political moment marked by climate catastrophe, and what’s more, put that thinking into practice within the workshop space by creating works of poetry and criticism in ensemble. All toward the aim of collaboratively engaging in what we might call—in keeping with the Combahee River Collective, Sylvia Wynter, Fred Moten and others—theory in black, black thought, black study. ",,LIT; WCult:W,
CRWT,40.12,The Novels of Virginia Woolf:Radical Innovator,Orner,,"This is a class for creative writers and creative readers interested in reading and above all, enjoying, the strange, beautiful novels of Virginia Woolf, a radical innovator of English prose whose work, since the moment it first appeared – through to today – has opened up new, and fascinating storytelling possibilities for writers (and readers) ever since. Woolf’s singular work has inspired countless writers, including Eudora Welty, W.H. Auden, Toni Morrison (who wrote her master’s thesis on Woolf), Edna O’Brien, Michael Cunningham, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Zadie Smith, among many, many others. Woolf’s great subjects were memory and time and we’ll be examining, through close reading, the many technical innovations Woolf developed, as the well as the emotional risks she took, in order to capture memory and time on the page, such as her use of a unique combination of interiority and lyrical intensity. The class will begin with a look at Woolf’s landmark, book-length essay on the women’s struggle for independence and creative opportunity, A Room of One’s Own. We’ll be also be reading excerpts from a creative biography of Woolf and various essays by and about Woolf that concern, directly, her development as a writer who challenged much of what had come before. In order to trace, through three pivotal novels, Woolf’s creative development, our primary texts will be: Mrs. Dalloway, where Woolf breaks away from the constraints of traditional narrative, To The Lighthouse, perhaps her most beloved and most autobiographical book, and The Waves, arguably the most poetic, resonant, and challenging of her later works. Written work will be a combination of critical and creative responses to Woolf’s fiction.",,LIT; WCult:W,
CRWT,40.13,Contemporary Queer and Trans Asian American Poetry,,,"Amidst grief and inheritance, migration and abandonment, is a name one gives oneself. In this poetry workshop, we will examine poetry collections by queer and trans Asian Americans from the late twentieth century to the present, discussing questions of translation, borders, crossings, and reconstructions of the self through second languages and first histories. What are the silences of queer futures? What does it mean to write from or of an identity? How does one write while disowned from one or more identities? Participants will be asked to contemplate these questions in a creative and analytical writing practice culminating in critique workshops and a final poetry portfolio.

Rather than considering them primarily as authored, literary texts, however, we will investigate them as products of a professional and commercial system—not unlike Hollywood—and as popular media in an age without journalism. Plays will be grouped in clusters that foreground roughly contemporary texts and/or performances in dialogue and competition with each other. Readings will also address the physical and social spaces of performance and the controversies about theater. Students interested in twentieth century productions of early modern plays or more general twentieth century issues of media and performance are welcome.",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,51.02,Shakespeare's King Lear and Macbeth: Text and Film,,,"This course offers students the luxury of focusing exclusively on just two of Shakespeare’s tragedies--King Lear and Macbeth--which constitute the final two of Shakespeare’s most famous four tragedies. Over the past 10 years, there have been no fewer than three major films made of each play, the latest being the brand new Macbeth, starring Michael Fassbinder. That each play still invites yet another way of imagining the play suggests both the suspicion that maybe the play hasn’t yet been done right, and simultantously the sense that these two plays offer some kind of especially important statement for audiences in 2015. This class will focus on all such issues, textual and film production-oriented. There will be two papers and one final project.",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,51.04,Stories At the Edge of the World: Conquest and Contact in the Age of Shakespeare,Beckman,,"When did the world become global? Living an age of commerce and contact, the writers of Shakespeare's England were also diplomats, explorers, soldiers, colonizers, and cosmopolitans. They composed poems and plays with one hand and foreign dispatches with the other, each time wondering at the encounters and tensions of a rapidly expanding world. In this course, we'll explore stories of borderlands, wildernesses, colonies, voyages, and migration. As we read widely in literature and travel narratives—including Shakespeare's defense of refugees from the forgotten play, Sir Thomas More—we'll consider what these borderlands and exchanges offer the early modern imagination and what they looked like in reality. Along the way, we'll be challenged to consider how we tell stories about marginalized people and contested spaces in our own rapidly globalizing time. ",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,51.13,Gender and Power in Shakespeare,,,"The course will begin by defining the varieties of power inscribed in Shakespeare’s plays, and proceed to explore the following questions. Is language gender-inflicted? Do men and women speak ""different"" languages? How do power and gender affect each other? How do women negotiate power among themselves? How do men? How is power exerted and controlled in sexual relationships? How do unspoken social definitions exert their power over the politics of gender? Possible works studied will be drawn from The Rape of Lucrece, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, The Taming of the Shrew, The Merchant of Venice, Much Ado About Nothing, As You Like It, All’s Well That Ends Well, Othello, Macbeth, Troilus and Cressida, Coriolanus, Antony and Cleopatra, and The Winter’s Tale.

ENGL,52.01,Whitman and Dickinson,,,"How did contemporaries Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson respond to the challenges of their time, especially the Civil War? Examining their poetry in historical context enables us to see how they envisioned America. The brash Whitman and reclusive Dickinson constructed elaborate personae that express different understandings of self and community. Dividing our time evenly between the poets, we will study the literary devices at their disposal, focusing on the way form influences meaning. Enrollment is limited to 30. ",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,52.02,The Civil War in Literature,Boggs,,"Surveys in American literature often omit the Civil War. Yet the war called forth a vast range of literary responses, in genres as diverse as poetry, popular song, novels, and other prose genres. This course will examine how literature depicts the war, and where the limits of that depiction lie. Readings include Walt Whitman's Drum Taps, Herman Melville's Battle Pieces and Aspects of the War (1866), Louisa May Alcott's ""Hospital Sketches,"" Stephen Crane's Red Badge of Courage.

ENGL,52.03,Dave the Potter: Slavery Between Pots and Poems,Chaney,AAAS 82.05 COCO 03.01,"This course examines the work of David Drake, a South Carolinian slave who made some of the largest ceramic storage vessels in America during the 1850s, signing them and etching sayings and poems onto them as well. This seminar engages with Drake's poetry-pottery through critical and historical research, interpretive writing, and our own creative adventures in ceramic handicrafts. In addition to writing your own updated imitations of Dave Drake's poetry and attempting ceramic facsimiles of his earthenware, students will also spend time in the letterpress studio as a means of acquiring a deeper historical and aesthetic appreciation of Dave's life and work; it was while working as a typesetter for a regional newspaper that Dave acquired literacy. As a culminating assignment, students will contribute chapters to a scholarly book on Drake, which the instructor will edit.",,ART,
ENGL,52.04,The American Renaissance at Dartmouth,,,"F. O. Matthiessen coined the term “American Renaissance” in his groundbreaking book, The American Renaissance: Art and Expression in the Age of Emerson and Whitman (1941). At the outset of the nineteenth century American writers struggled with a sense of cultural inferiority and artistic belatedness. The “American Renaissance” demarcates a period as well as a cultural movement marked by intense literary activity between the 1830s and 1860s that aimed at the formation of a distinctively American literature. Matthiessen restricted the American Renaissance to the years between 1850 and 1855, an “extraordinarily concentrated moment of literary expression” (vii) that saw the publication of Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter, House of the Seven Gables, and The Blithedale Romance; Ralph Waldo Emerson’s Representative Men; Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick; Henry David Thoreau’s Walden; and Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass. In the years since the publication of Matthiessen’s important work, teachers and scholars in American literature have extended the American Renaissance’s chronological provenance at least as far back as the anti-slavery debates in the 1830s and as far forward as the termination of the Civil War. In the past several decades, Matthiessen’s argument has been challenged for its exaggeration of the originality of his coterie of male authors, for the exclusion of women and African-American and popular authors from his account of the United States during a period of remarkable social and cultural transformation, and for its seemingly uncritical acceptance of the doctrine of American exceptionalism. In light of these criticisms, scholars have added Emily Dickinson, Frederick Douglass, Margaret Fuller, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Mark Twain (among others) to Matthiessen’s American Renaissance pantheon.",,,
ENGL,52.05,Desire and Difference in 19th Century British Fiction,Dever,WGSS 48.08,"This course will examine the phenomenon of moral panic in nineteenth-century British literature and culture through two linked but distinctive forms of sexual subjectivity:  female heterosexuality and male homosexuality, connected forever in the 1885 Criminal Law Amendment Act that set the stage for the imprisonment of Oscar Wilde. We will consider the relationship between realist and sensationalist literary forms to trace the emergence and regulation of distinctly modern sexual subjectivities in mid- and late-nineteenth-century Britain.",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,52.06,Media & Monstrosity,McCann,COLT 62.04,"The vampire, the doppelganger, the automaton, the femme fatale, the serial killer, even the city itself as a pathological public space: these figures inhabit popular fiction at the end of the nineteenth century, expressionist cinema at the start of the twentieth century, and have been staples of mass culture ever since. Focusing on the relationship between fin-de-siècle Gothic fiction and its early cinematic adaptation, this course will explore the images of monstrosity that embody anxieties about changing media landscapes, emerging media forms, and the increasingly mediated character of human relationships between the 1880s and the 1920s. Primary texts and films will include R.L. Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Bram Stoker’s Dracula, F.W. Murnau’s Nosferatu, and Fritz Lang’s Metropolis.

ENGL,52.10,Vox Clamantis: Wilderness in 19thC American Literature,Chaney,,"Inspired by the motto of Dartmouth College, this course examines tropes of wilderness in nineteenth-century American literature and the types of voices that cry out within them. While helping to establish a national literary tradition, the American 'deserto' or wilderness has also functioned as a kind of rhetorical staging area, in which various (often competing) notions of individualism, community, and political philosophy emerge. As a result, the novels, poems, slave narratives, and short stories of nineteenth-century American literature abound with landscapes as social and psychological as they are physical.  Authors will include Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, Frederick Douglass, Emily Dickinson, Herman Melville, Henry David Thoreau, Charles Chesnutt, Mark Twain, and Willa Cather.  Dist: LIT; WCult: W.

The Court found in favor of Dartmouth, which preserved the College as a private entity. Perhaps more importantly, it also laid the legal foundation for the modern economy, where corporate firms are to some extent free of state control. This course aims for a comprehensive understanding of the Dartmouth College Case and Daniel Webster by integrating the perspectives of American studies, history, political theory, and law.",,TMV,
ENGL,52.15,Transatlantic Gothic,,,"From crumbling monasteries and crafty priests, to bleeding nuns and fake hauntings, gothic novels exploded in popularity in late eighteenth century British print culture. But what happens when the strange tropes, figures, and rhetorical techniques of the gothic travel across the Atlantic to adapt to the dark pathologies and monstrous histories of the Americas? This course will expand notions of the gothic to frameworks that understand late eighteenth to early nineteenth century gothic literature as a transatlantic phenomenon.",,LIT,
ENGL,52.16,"God, Darwin, and the Literary Imagination",Harner,,"The publication of Charles Darwin’s The Origin of Species in 1859 caused a crisis in religious faith. Evolution brought God to his knees, or so the story goes. Yet this claim over-simplifies the situation. It underestimates how the Christian God and evolutionary theory both shaped debates and structures of thought in the nineteenth century. How did these “divergent” systems of belief shape how people understood the world and their place in it? How did writers use religious faith and/or scientific evidence to structure narrative and tell new types of stories? How did Darwin and other scientists use literary techniques to convey their ideas to a widespread audience? This course emphasizes close reading as well as historical and scientific context, focusing on five themes that arose from the juxtaposition of God and Darwin in nineteenth-century British literature and culture: Creation and Design, Selection and Extinction, Heredity and Development, Time and Progress, and Human/Animal.",,TMV; WCult:W,
ENGL,52.17,Victorian Children's Literature: Fairytale and Fantasy,Harner,,"It is said that the Victorians “invented” childhood: a state of freedom, play, creativity, and innocence. The orphans, adventurers, tricksters, and runaways in Victorian children’s books make friends with pirates, talk to animals, fly through the sky, and fall down rabbit holes. What made these stories so popular in the nineteenth century, and why do they continue to enchant readers? This course explores the genre of Victorian children’s literature in relation to such themes as Romantic innocence, nature and animal studies, climate change, sexuality and queerness, evolution, colonialism and race, disability studies, global economics, and play. Throughout the course, we’ll think about how stories for children are constructed and how writers and artists have adapted these Victorian texts for later audiences (e.g. through film, graphic novels, and fan fiction). The course will include both critical and creative assignments. Texts may include: Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Lewis Carroll), Treasure Island (Robert Louis Stevenson), The Jungle Books (Rudyard Kipling), Peter Pan (J. M. Barrie), The Secret Garden (Frances Hodgson Burnett), and fairytales by Oscar Wilde.",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,52.18,Netflix and the Victorian Serial Novel,Harner,,"How does the shape of a narrative change the way we experience it? Beginning in 1836 with Charles Dickens’ first novel, Victorian audiences often read texts as weekly and monthly ‘parts’ rather than as literary ‘wholes’. In 2007, Netflix introduced streaming, and in 2013, the company began producing original content. Instead of waiting a week for the next television episode, audiences could binge watch entire seasons (or more). Both the serial and digital streaming have been called revolutionary, but what does this mean? This course pairs Victorian serial novels and Netflix original series in order to think critically about structure and form. How does the play between serial part and whole necessitate new temporalities, strategies of characterization and narration, and types of suspense? How does binge-watching disrupt or reshape narrative time and sequencing? How have both new forms altered cultural discourses on gender, social consciousness, crime, and politics? How do narratives intersect with other types of seriality, including evolution, reproduction and inheritance, election cycles, and the #MeToo movement? This course emphasizes close reading and watching as well as narrative theory and reception and moves between nineteenth-century novels and twenty-first century series.",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,52.21,Popular Fiction and the Culture of Empire,,,"The nineteenth century saw an explosion in the diversity and commercial potential of popular fiction. Detective fiction, science fiction, and the Gothic novel are a few of the genres that came into their own during this period, partly as a result of their ability to evoke the fantasies and anxieties of Victorian Britain and its empire. In this course we will think about the relationship of popular texts to imperial visions of race, sexuality, exploration, evolution, extinction, and invasion. We will also look at the relationship between fiction, the commercialization of publishing and the emergence of new media technologies like photography and film. Writers may include Mary Braddon, H. Rider Haggard, Bram Stoker, H.G. Wells, Robert Louis Stevenson, Arthur Machen, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Marie Corelli.",,LIT,

ENGL,53.04,Telling Stories for Social Change,"Schweitzer, Hernandez",WGSS 66.05,"Telling My Story for Social Change uses readings in theory and practice (journals, exercises, performance) to explore the difficult themes of Race, Class, and Gender. By practicing listening, speaking and withholding judgment in a group, we build relations based on trust, communication, and dialogue. To do this, we must first identify and dismantle the visible and invisible walls of preconception and bias that surround us, which many times we actively help to create and maintain.    ",,ART; WCult:CI,

In this course we will, via the close reading of its literature and its history, create our own distinct blueprint of Dublin, and attempt to write our own narratives of the city. We will study the ways in which literature contributes to a particular imagined cosmopolitan that is not only necessary to the vital life of the city but also to the cultural identity of its people. Some of the writers to be considered include: James Joyce, Sean O’Casey, Samuel Beckett, Flann O’Brien, Aiden Higgins, Brendan Behan, Patrick Kavanagh, Emma Donaghue, Claire Keegan, Roddy Doyle, Colm Tóibín, John Banville, Eavan Boland, Anne Hartigan, Kevin Barry, Bernard McLaverty, Patrick McGabe, Neil Jordan, Edna O’Brien, Sebastian Barry, Colum McCann, Eílís Ní Dhuibne and Anne Enright.

ENGL,53.07,Black Noir,,AAAS 81.07 FILM 47.25,"In this course, we will study black American literature that focuses the noir genre on black people themselves. We will read gritty, urban crime novels that attempt to expose inequities in black American lives and dispel the notion that a descent from whiteness results in blackness. Rather, the black people in these texts exist in darkness because they are living in alienated communities. We shall investigate how the noir genre is altered when “noirs” are the subjects and the authors. In addition to primary texts, the course will engage critical responses to these works.",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,53.08,Weird Fiction and the Limits of the Human,,,"What makes the dark so terrifying? Why do humans use fiction to invent strange creatures and supernatural threats? How does horror contribute to what it means to be human? What does the weird or the strange tell us about society? This course examines the literary, philosophical, and social aspects of weird fiction, a tradition of literature and genre fiction running from the early nineteenth century up to the present. It examines the most well-known writer of the weird, H.P. Lovecraft, but it also looks at work by Mary Shelley, Edgar Allan Poe, Octavia Butler, Victor LaValle, Kelly Link, Jeff VanderMeer, and others. The course introduces students to the study of genre fiction, theoretical approaches to literature (including posthumanism, psychoanalysis, and ecotheory), and cultural studies (including critical race theory and feminism). It asks students to consider how weird fiction challenges racism, misogyny, homophobia, and colonialism. While no prior training in critical theory is necessary, students are encouraged to have some familiarity in analyzing and writing on literature. The class will also offer opportunities for creative efforts and experimental writing.",,LIT; WCult:W,

They often bring powerful bicultural perspectives to their tasks of survival and opportunity seeking, however, and are increasingly active in struggles for cultural expression and social and economic justice. We will examine the different conditions for women in a variety of immigrant groups in America, reading in several histories, anthologies of feminist criticism, interdisciplinary surveys, and relevant texts in critical theory, and on the words, in autobiography, poetry, and fiction, of foreign-born women writers.

These works imagine a democratized space where colonial violence is avenged, American law is malleable, and intellect triumphs over racism. While most critics applaud such decolonizing efforts, we will ask more difficult questions: do these sensational narratives do real cultural work? Do they suggest that colonial violence begets only more violence? And in the end, who are its true victims? ",,LIT; WCult:W,

We explore how their poetry contributes to the reclamation and continuity of tribal memory and the regeneration of tribal traditions and communities. Our course includes lyric voices from the reservation, from the city, and from indigenous spaces in dyasporic and global contexts.  We will examine the combined influences that oral tradition, ritual life, and tribal values have on these contemporary poets. The indigenous poetic voice occupies a unique position in contemporary American poetry, but also in the discourse of settler colonialism. This course traces how the themes of these poetic voices bring forward images of past and contemporary experience, to craft a poetic tradition that is distinctly indigenous.

How might the “bad” and the “queer” name the refusal and failure to assimilate and align oneself with racial capital, settler colonial logics, and reproductive futurity? How might both terms require us to rethink what narratives of belonging look, feel, and sound like and in turn, become the grounds for alternative solidarities, affiliations, and intimacies across lines of minority difference? To answer these questions, we will engage with primarily contemporary Asian/American works of literature, poetry, film, performance, and art that alters, disrupts, and varies Asian/American narratives of migration, assimilation, and upward mobility. Through these works, we will address historical processes of Asian/American racial, gender, and sexual formation by way of the “bad” and the “queer,” as transformative political and aesthetic categories of inquiry that risk failing to fit in, being wrong, and not belonging.",,LIT; WCult:CI,
ENGL,53.39,Haunted Houses in American Literature,Clark,,"This course takes a tour of haunted houses in American literature and film. What happens when the specter-filled estates of the European Gothic novel are transposed from the wild and windy moors of England into the corn fields of middle America? Or the hallways of the apartment building? Or the bungalows of suburbia? What does it mean to be haunted? What does it mean to be a house? Visiting mansions and plantations, churches and asylums, apartments and cabins, wombs and spaceships, we will consider who—and what—has been haunting the dwelling places of the 20th century and contemporary American imaginary. Authors will include William Faulkner, Toni Morrison, Edgar Allan Poe, and Shirley Jackson.",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,53.40,The Historical Philosophy of W.E.B. Dubois,,AAAS 80.10 PHIL 01.13,"This course will examine the historical philosophy of the towering Black scholar and great freedom fighter of the 20th Century. We shall engage in close readings of Du Bois’ classic work, The Souls of Black Folk (1903) as well as subsequent essays in his magisterial corpus, especially his classic autobiography, Dusk of Dawn (1940).",,,
ENGL,53.41,Black Love & Its Discontents: Barry Jenkins,Bennett,,"How might we think about the shape, tenor, and texture of something like black love, its core principles and practices, in a world where anti-black sentiment serves as a structural logic? In the midst of such unrelenting violence, how have black people managed to love each other, love themselves, love living? What language have they crafted, historically, to describe such an expansive, radical project? For the purposes of this course, we will linger with a wide range of cinematic and literary moments with the aim of framing a much larger conversation about the uses of black art-making as a means through which we might access a critical vocabulary for black feeling; might assert the breaking into the world of a black love that is both resistance and that which exceeds it, love as a sort of black operation, black love as an act of marronage. Towards that end, this course will employ the films of contemporary writer and director Barry Jenkins, and place them in direct conversation with a larger constellation of writings within the African American literary tradition. Through our collective investigation of these texts, we will work together toward the elaboration of an aesthetics of black love.",,,
ENGL,53.42,"Postmodern&quot; Britain: Fictions of Pluralism, Dystopia (and Brexit)",Harner,,"Contemporary Britain can be seen as a divided state: leave versus remain, cosmopolitan urbanism against conservative rural communities, post-imperial malaise and the rise of global Anglophone influence. Britain is also a literary hotbed, home to the Man Booker Prize for Fiction and an arena in which cultural production (and social debates) still take the form of narrative. What is “Britain” at the start of the twenty-first century, in what is ostensibly a post-war, post-imperial, and post-modern era? How do fiction writers respond to the twin pulls of national nostalgia and multicultural, intersectional identities? How do experiments in narrative form and genre speak to the emergence of new social and political formations? How does contemporary British fiction adapt or respond to a longer (and well-established) lineage of UK novelists (from Austen and Dickens to Virginia Woolf)? This course focuses on British fiction published after 1980, including works by authors who identify as Black British, queer, feminist, Muslim, and immigrant. Possible authors include Zadie Smith, A. S. Byatt, Ian McEwan, Sarah Waters, Kazuo Ishiguro, Jeanette Winterson, and Hanif Kureishi.",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,53.43,"Race and Modernity: W.E.B. DuBois, James Baldwin, Lorraine Hansberry",,AAAS 21.10 PHIL 01.17,"This course will examine the classical works of three towering modern intellectuals: W.E.B. Du Bois, James Baldwin, and Lorraine Hansberry. We will wrestle with the rich formulations, subtle arguments, and courageous visions of three Black thinkers who continue to speak with power and passion to our turbulent times.",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,53.44,Indians in American Literature,,NAS 031,"Indians are uncanny absences in the American narrative and yet persistent fixtures in our national literature from its origins to the present day. This course examines the pervasive appearance of the seductive, strange, and evolving Indian figure in works by prominent American authors such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, James Fenimore Cooper, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, Willa Cather, and Toni Morrison. We will explore the shifting and ideological role of the Indian as tragic emblem, savage defender, spiritual ally, and modern foil. We will explore the complicated ways that the literary Indian has served to both authenticate and trouble the nation's founding narratives and desires, and more recently, to stand as a mythical antidote to postmodern crises of value, economics, ecology, and spirituality. We will consider the appeal of such tropes in particular regional and historical contexts, such as the Reconstruction South, as well as racial or ethnic ones, such as the African American appropriation of Indian resistance, nobility, and genealogies.",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,53.45,Storytelling in Novels and Community,McKee,,"This course will focus on the role of storytelling and its importance to community in works of literature and anthropology. Rather than study short stories, we will consider why novels, as longer forms of fiction, nevertheless include storytelling by characters. How does such storytelling work? We will read several twentieth-century novels in which characters telling stories function as means of reforming community. In novels and anthropological study, we will pay particular attention to the ways that storytelling can reconceive identities of individuals and of history, at times opening up both so that persons and history become diverse and extensive. The boundaries of community may also become extensive, resisting containment and refusing to conform to a common cultural identity. We will read Walter Benjamin’s essay “The Storyteller” as well as several critical essays focusing on storytelling. Novels will include William Faulkner’s The Hamlet and Absalom, Absalom, Michael Ondaatje’s The English Patient, and Toni Morrison’s Paradise. Works of anthropology will include Kathleen Stewart’s A Space on the Side of the Road: Cultural Poetics in an “Other” America.",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,53.46,New York and the Metropolitan Imagination in Twentieth-Century American Jewish Literature,Caplan,JWST 021,"This course will offer an introduction to American Jewish culture by focusing on the perception of New York City among successive generations of Jewish writers, performers, and cultural activists. Although our focus will be primarily on literary sources, in English and translated from Yiddish, we will also consider memoirs, political documents, journalism, music, and film. The topics we will consider include:How are the ambivalences of immigration expressed among Jewish immigrants writing, alternately, in English or in Yiddish?",,LIT; WCult:CI,
ENGL,53.47,African Diaspora Women Writers,Brown,AAAS 67.06 WGSS 66.07,"This course will be organized around four themes prevalent in contemporary portrayals of Black women across the African diaspora. The themes, Body, Voice, Memory, and Movement provide a center from which discussions of agency, representation and counter-narrative can be situated within a larger discourse of canon formation. We will explore various parts of the United States and the Caribbean through analyses of literature and visual culture, paying particular attention to shifting dialogues of culture and identity. Among the central questions posed will be: What constitutes a feminist ideology in black women’s literature? How are images of subjection and victimization re-appropriated by Black women writers and image-makers and utilized for their own empowerment? What are the penalties inherent when a Black woman “comes to voice” in the arena of self-representation?",,LIT; WCult:CI,
ENGL,53.48,Poetry for the People,,AAAS 35.60,"The central concern of this class is the historical relationship between the social lives of everyday people and U.S. American poetics, with a special emphasis on what June Jordan once termed the “difficult miracle of Black poetry in America.” How does poetry help us to know one another? And how might we better understand the particular role of poetry, of poesis, for those historically barred from the very practice of reading or writing, from ownership (even of one’s own body), and various generally recognized forms of belonging? For the purposes of this course, these will be some of our animating questions.",,LIT; WCult:CI,
ENGL,53.49,Graphic Medicine,Chaney,,"What does sickness look like? What do personal picture-stories of illness and recovery tell us that traditional medical narratives cannot? In this course, students will read graphic narratives depicting first-hand experiences of physical (dis)ability, mental illness, disease, and neurodivergence. Discussion and readings will explore autobiography, word-image theories and comics analysis, as well as competing conceptions of illness and recovery within and across primary texts. Other readings will include scholarship on the ethics of storytelling and patient-centered perspectives on medicine. Authors may include David B., Ellen Forney, Art Spiegelman, Cece Bell, Harvey Pekar, Frank Miller, and others.",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,54.01,Shakespeare Adaptations,,,"What happens when movie writers and directors adapt Shakespeare’s plays for the screen? How does an audience’s awareness of a literary precedent influence reception? What kinds of adaptations do we value and what role does their faithfulness to originals play? This course will look at twelve adaptations of major plays that most consider somewhat radical (e.g. Chicken Rice War; Omkara, Ran, Forbidden Planet, Scotland, P.A.) exploring the conceptual and cinematic strengths of the adaptations, as well as what their attempts to preserve or recast elements of Shakespeare’s plays reveals about the energies of the originals. Each film should thus prove a site of discussion in its own right, as well as an interpretive text that both critiques and argues the merits of the source text. Students can expect to read seven plays and see at least two adaptations of each, writing short responses to each play and film on canvas. Course Group IV",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,54.02,Arts of Laughter: Comedy and Criticism,,,"What makes us laugh? Does laughter have the power to change the world? Can comedy transform society? These are only some of the questions that this course addresses. This course examines literary works, stand-up comedy, rom-coms and classic Hollywood comedy, and sit-com television (among other comedic forms) in order to consider the capacity for comedy to criticize the status quo and effect social change. It also investigates theoretical approaches to comedy and laughter, such as Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalytic interpretation of jokes and Henri Bergson’s philosophy of laughter, which ask why we laugh in the first place. Literary works and films may include Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night, Samuel Beckett’s Waiting For Godot, Charlie Chaplin’s Modern Times, and Judd Apatow and Amy Schumer’s Trainwreck. We will also discuss stand-up performances by the likes of Aziz Ansari, Louis C. K., and Margaret Cho; sit-com programs including I Love Lucy, Blackish, and Fresh Off The Boat; and skit shows such as Saturday Night Live and Chappelle’s Show. Students will have the opportunity to not only write about comedy but also produce and perform comedy. Enrollment limited to 30. ",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,54.03,Young Adult Literature,Stuelke,WGSS 51.09,"This course explores the genre of young adult fiction in the 20th and 21st centuries. While the course will begin with a brief consideration of the conventions and early history of the genre, most of the course will examine post-1970s (mostly American) young adult novels. We’ll trace the evolution of the genre in relation to ideas of racial innocence, sentimentality, consent, queer childhood, and revolutionary girlhood, and position the novels within historical contexts such as the rise of mass incarceration, settler colonialism, fantasies of post-racial politics, and environmental disaster. At the end of the course, we’ll consider how young adult novels have created not just reading but creative communities, and explore the kinds of fan productions that have emerged in relation to young adult novels. The course will include critical and creative assignments. Texts may include The Hunger Games; the Harry Potter series; Are You There God; It’s Me Margaret; The Outsiders; The Astonishing Life of Octavian Nothing; Vivian Apple at the End of the World; Fangirl; Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe; Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian; The Fault in Our Stars; Ship Breaker; Long Division; Monster; Akata Witch; Make Your Home Among Strangers.",,LIT; WCult:CI,
ENGL,54.04,"Beautiful, Ugly, Cute, Dumpy: An Introduction to Aesthetics",,,"This course is an introduction to literary aesthetics, beginning with Immanuel Kant’s The Critique of Judgment (1790), a foundational text of Western aesthetics which provocatively and systematically explains how people enjoy and judge art, and why they discuss it together. Careful analysis of Kant’s Critique will be followed by revisions and extensions of his theory of taste in 20th and 21st century aesthetics and literary theory. This includes Austin, Genette, Adorno, Zangwill, Ngai, among others.",,TMV; WCult:W,
ENGL,54.05,"Animal Studies: Theory, Literature, Politics",Harner,,"The emergent field of animal studies tackles pressing philosophical and ethical questions about who we are as a species. How are the distinctions between “animal” and “human” understood, destabilized, and/or deconstructed? What does it mean to recognize animals as sentient beings endowed with their own agencies rather than objects for use by humans? This course provides an introduction to animal studies, including such questions as inter-species communication, extinction, animal rights, ecologies, and species identities. Students will study texts across the interdisciplinary field by such authors as Lacan, Derrida, Deleuze, Haraway, Wolfe, Chen, and Moore, as well as foundational texts by Darwin, Montaigne, and Freud. As a class, we will discuss how theoretical perspectives on animals alter our readings of literary texts—including fiction by such authors as Rudyard Kipling, J. M. Coetzee, Karen Joy Fowler, Virginia Woolf, Yann Martel, and Franz Kafka—even as we raise contemporary concerns about climate change, extinction, and species justice.",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,54.11,Poetry and Poetic Theory,,,"In this course, we will primarily examine theories of poetry, relying mainly on The Norton Anthology of Criticism and Theory and Poetry in Theory, 1900-2000 (Blackwell). These volumes provide a rich, comprehensive overview of poetic theory from its beginnings in Greek antiquity virtually to the present, covering Anglo-American, Continental, and other theorists. No single poetry anthology will be used, but poetic examples will be studied at every stage, generally posted on Blackboard. We will consider the ""philosophy"" of poetic composition in different historical periods and contexts, and will examine the continuing interplay between poetic theory and practice. The point of the course will be to get a grip on ways in which people have thought about poetry from the earliest times to the present, and to consider the sometimes antagonistic interplay between theorizing about poetry and writing it.",,LIT,
ENGL,54.13,Digital Game Studies,Evens,,"This course explores digital gaming. Reading academic and popular texts, we will situate digital gaming in relation to new media, visual, and literary studies. Class discussion will focus on outstanding problems in digital game studies: Where do the histories of technology and gaming meet? How do games change players and how do games shape culture? What about designers and programmers? In what ways are digital games playful and what aspects of them are expressive? What is the future of gaming? Of course this class will also study particular games, and, in addition to writing academic essays, students will invent individual and group projects in the game domain.",,TAS,
ENGL,54.15,History of the Book,Halasz,COLT 40.01,"This course examines the book as a material and cultural object. We’ll consider various practical and theoretical models for understanding the book form and investigating the materials, technologies, institutions, and practices of its production, dissemination, and reception. We’ll focus primarily on the printed book in Western Europe and North America, but we’ll also discuss the emergence of the codex (book), medieval manuscript books, twentieth and twenty-first century artist’s books and the challenges posed by digitality to the book form. The readings for the course will be balanced by frequent use of exemplars drawn from Rauner Library and practical experience setting type in the Book Arts workshop.  ",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,54.16,Literary Classics,Tanoukhi,,"Hamlet, Paradise Lost, Pride and Prejudice, Wuthering Heights, The Waste Land: These texts are among the cornerstones of a literary canon that still exerts enormous influence even as it is intensely contested. How does a play, a novel, or a poem become a “literary classic”? In this course, we will read a series of indisputably “great” texts in order to understand the complex forms of evaluation (aesthetic, political, moral, and commercial) that both underpin and revise notions of canonicity. Drawing on theoretical work by Gauri Viswanathan, Pierre Bourdieu, Theodor Adorno, and Pascale Casanova, we will also consider the varied institutional contexts (from the colonial civil service to the liberal arts classroom, from small presses to multinational publishers, from Masterpiece Theatre to contemporary Bollywood) that govern these processes.

ENGL,54.17,Psychoanalysis and Philosophy,,COCO 034,"This class will stage an encounter between psychoanalysis and philosophy, introducing students to both fields by placing them side by side. Drawing on the complementary expertises of the two-person teaching team, weekly readings will pair at least two texts, including one from each primary field, to illuminate similarities and differences between psychoanalytic theory on the one hand and philosophical concepts on the other, noting where appropriate the mutual influence of the two fields. Because psychoanalysis is also a clinical practice, this interdisciplinary encounter raises the question of the practical dimension of philosophical thought, and we will ask about philosophy’s potential impact on lived experience, as well as whether the practice of psychoanalysis remains a valuable mode of treatment or an aid to everyday living. To help organize the broad questions at the intersections of psychoanalysis and philosophy, we will divide the class loosely into four thematic units, the unconscious, Oedipus, interpretation, and transference. Class will proceed mostly through guided discussion; assignments will include reading responses plus midterm and final papers, with opportunities for additional credit so that students might pursue their own interests within the course subject matters.",,TMV; WCult:W,
ENGL,54.40,Literary Culture in an Age of Digital Distraction,,,"This course is organized around two main projects that will investigate the interesting and compelling ways that ""traditional"" forms of literacy are evolving to coexist with digital and social media. First, students will choose a contemporary practice, tool, or genre in which print and digital media have converged (e.g. book lists on Goodreads, e-book hardware, ""Twitter fiction""), exploring what if anything is ""new"" about it. Next, student groups will design and prototype a digital technology that reimagines the ways that literature is produced or consumed in the context of digital media. This project will accommodate students with varying levels of technical expertise, though no programming experience is presumed. Throughout the course, readings on the history of media, the ethnography of literacy, and human-computer interaction will guide both our writing and production.",,ART,
ENGL,55.01,Modern American Women Poets,,,"This course focuses on the emerging counter-tradition, within American modernism and within the larger tradition of poetry in English, of American women poets in the twentieth century. Taking our cue from Adrienne Rich, who ambiguously titles one book of essays On Lies, Secrets and Silences (is she for or against?), we will follow debates about what makes it possible to break previous silences--and to what degree and in what ways it is useful or satisfying to do so. Topics within this discussion will include sexuality, race, illness, literary modes, female literary succession, and relations with the literary tradition. We will read in the work of eight or nine poets and recent critical and theoretical writings, with some attention in the first weeks to important female and male precursors. The syllabus will include such writers as Edna St.Vincent Millay, HD, Gertrude Stein, Elizabeth Bishop, Gwendolyn Brooks, Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton, Audre Lorde, Adrienne Rich, Marilyn Hacker, Louise Gluck, Rita Dove.

ENGL,55.06,Reading and Publishing the Literary Magazine,,,"The course offers students instruction and opportunities in literary journal operations from the editorial process to defining and maintaining the journal and its agenda. Ethical questions of blind review and the diversity of contributors will also be discussed, as well as issues of promotion and social media and the use of other digital tools. Students will gain invaluable experience in publication systems, copy editing, professional communications,and marketing. Field trips to other campuses or events to meet with representatives of similar student-run publications will be a means of cultivating not only new ideas but also a developing sense in the students of professionalism and community. Enrollment is limited to 15.",,ART,
ENGL,55.07,The Arts of War,,,"Walt Whitman said of the American Civil War: ""the real war will never get in the books."" This course will raise core questions about how war is remembered and represented through text, performance, and visual culture. Our questions will be anchored in concrete case studies but will also raise far-ranging philosophical, ethical, and historical questions that examine instances of war in relation to the aesthetics of war.",,INT or ART,
ENGL,55.08,Neuroscience and the Novel,,,"Over the past few years it has been suggested that since the 1990s there has been a major shift in how novels represent characters and consciousness. This new type of novel has been called the ""neuronovel."" This course takes up questions at the intersection of psychology, neuroscience, and literary studies to explore this thesis. We'll read contemporary work by neurologists and psychologists (Damasio, Sacks, Gazzaniga, Schacter) as well as their late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century precursors (Freud, James, Brentano, Beard) alongside a wide range of literature that allows us to think about the intersection of race, gender, and sexuality with the universalist claims of various scientific and pseudoscientific accounts of the self. Key literary texts include Shelley, McEwan, Lethem, James, Poe, Woolf, Roth, and Wright.",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,55.09,Hope? How Feelings Shape American Culture,,,"Barack Obama defined hope as a culturally transformative feeling that required “audacity.” Yet scholars have questioned hope’s ability to bring about change, leading Lauren Berlant to speak of “Cruel Optimism.” Hope, Optimism, Audacity, Cruelty: how does affect impact American culture? We will develop frames for thinking historically and analytically about feeling’s influence on class, gender and ethnicity. Students will develop final projects that integrate imagination into an analysis of the questions hope raises.",,TMV; WCult:W,
ENGL,55.11,Hamilton: The Revolution as a Work of Art,Boggs,,"In Hamilton: The Revolution (the book of annotated lyrics and account of the musical’s production), Lin-Manuel Miranda and his collaborators create two frames for their work’s significance. One is the historical American Revolution of the 18th century, which the musical rereads via the figure of the orphan-immigrant; the other references their own musical, which they describe as an act of cultural revolution in its engagement with the racial politics of the early millennium. What does it mean to read revolution as a work of art, and Hamilton as its artistic reinterpretation? In this course, we will develop frames for thinking analytically about Hamilton’s artistic engagement with class, gender and ethnicity in the historic past as well as our own moment.",,SOC; WCult:CI,
ENGL,55.12,Dartmouth Fictions,Dobson,,"This is a course about the campus novel and literary representations of Dartmouth College. Dartmouth, as both a setting and object of analysis, has appeared in numerous cultural objects as alumni, students, and those looking in from the outside have reflected on the intellectual and social life of the College. Many major cultural works—from Ralph Waldo Emerson’s “Literary Ethics” to August Wilson’s King Hedley II—were written or first performed at Dartmouth. But the College’s campus and its students have also inspired countless fictional and autobiographical works. Throughout the term, we’ll examine the myriad ways in which Dartmouth has been represented by reading a selection of novels and memoirs set on our campus. We will also read a selection of poetry and examine digital productions depicting Dartmouth and Dartmouth students, including memes and textual forms of social media. Finally, we will visit Rauner’s special collections to examine primary materials, including artifacts and texts from the College’s past, to produce a research paper that locates a text within its historical context.",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,55.13,South African Literature in English,Orner,,"This course will examine works by South African men and women of various ethnicities who have chosen to write in English since the publication of Olive Schreiner's Story of an African Farm in 1883. This richly diverse literature will be tracked through the cultural and political history of South Africa with primary emphasis on the twentieth and twenty-first centuries before and after the fall of Apartheid. Confrontation between black militancy and white oppression characterizes much writing and social interaction in South Africa before the fall of Apartheid, but complex forms of multi-ethnic coexistence and interchange have also been evident since the first white settlement of the country in 1652. Recent work by J.M. Coetzee and Zakes Mda among others explores the difficult, unmapped terrain of post-Apartheid South Africa. Works by the following writers may be included in the course: Olive Schreiner, Solomon Plaatje, Bessie Head, Nadine Gordimer, Zoe Wicomb, Alan Paton, J.M Coetzee, Njabulo Ndebele, Athol Fugard, Nelson Mandela.",,LIT; WCult:CI,
ENGL,55.14,Native American Oral Traditional Literatures,Palmer,,Native American oral tradition constitutes a rich and complex dimension of the American literary heritage. This course will examine a range of oral genres from several time periods and tribal sources. Oral traditions and the textual sources into which they are anthologized provide valuable insights into the nature of human creativity. They are also full of unique hermeneutical challenges. This course will include some contemporary theoretical approaches to orality and the metaphysics of the voice to unpack some of these questions.,,LIT,
ENGL,55.15,The Merchant of Venice: The Jew in the Protestant Imagination,,JWST 070 REL 74.12,"This seminar is an interdisciplinary study of Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice that will examine the history of Christianity's attitudes toward Judaism, the fate of Jews within Christian Europe, especially in England prior to the expulsion of the Jews in 1290, and the effect of these histories on the composition of the play, the representations of its main characters, particularly Shylock and Portia, and its reception through the centuries, with attention to its role in modern attitudes toward Jews and toward anti-Semitism. We will approach the material as scholars of history, literature, and religion. We expect to attend closely to the gendered and racialized representations of Jewishness and Christianness in the play and in English culture more generally. The impact of the play will be examined with particular reference to modern German and English literary traditions. We will also examine some major developments in the staging of the play, with particular attention to Yiddish versions, Israeli productions, and Nazi-era German stagings, as well as several film versions. A selection from the major critical literature on the play will be studied.",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,55.16,Prehistoric Worlds: Science Fiction and Geological Time,,,"Ever since natural historians like Charles Lyell and Charles Darwin radically expanded the time scale of Earth’s history, modern writers and filmmakers have looked for new ways to mediate “deep time.” This course is an introduction to their work. During the semester, we discuss the techniques they use to portray the passage of geological time. We also question the political implications of these representations—what they tell us about society in the present. Finally, we consider deep time as an inspiration for new philosophical concepts. The course has three sections: “Deep Time and Early Science Fiction”; “Cold War Countercultures”; and “The Anthropocene.” In addition to essays and exams, we complete a field project about the Harvard Museum of Natural History.",,TMV; WCult:W,

ENGL,55.18,Research As Picture Books,,,"In this course, students will convert cutting-edge scholarship by a select group of participating Dartmouth researchers into picture books for children, complete with characters and stories (even when the research primarily involves scientific data). Students will learn the basics of picture book composition and design by analyzing classics in relevant sub-genres (there’s a bird laboratory at Cornell that puts out a regular series of picture books that will also be useful as models). In collaborative teams and working closely with the professor and their assigned researcher, students will pitch and defend their ideas, produce mock-up picture books, and present other documents simulating the professional experience of seeking publication for their projects.",,ART,
ENGL,55.19,Maroons to Marley: Jamaica's Role in Worldwide Revolutions from Slavery to the Present Day,,AAAS 62.50,"In 1738, a hundred years before legal emancipation came to England’s New World slave colonies, Jamaica’s Maroons forced the colonial power to sign a treaty granting sovereignty to Maroon communities across the Caribbean island. As the first Africans in the New World to achieve this feat, Maroon warriors directly and indirectly influenced abolitionist and revolutionary movements throughout the Americas—including, of course, revolts in Haiti and the United States. These warriors continued to inspire the revolutionary actions of other oppressed and/or enslaved individuals for generations, and indeed, a revolutionary ethos pervades Jamaican culture and artistic production from the colonial period to the present moment. This course traces the impact of “Jamaican” revolutionary figures on other revolutionary figures and events worldwide. Moving chronologically, from colonialism to the present day, the course examines influences such as African/Jamaican Maroon leaders direct impact on other revolutions throughout the Americas; Mary Seacole’s exchanges with and impact on Florence Nightingale during the Crimean War; Marcus Garvey’s impact on the Harlem Renaissance and the Rastafari religion; Claude McKay’s revolutionary impact on vernacular poetics and on the “Red Scare;” Louise Bennett’s mid-twentieth century revolutionary, feminist, vernacular poetics and her impact on female performers in the Americas, Europe, and Africa; Bob Marley and Damian Marley’s impact on politics and revolutionary movements in Liberia and Ghana; and finally, the impact of Staceyann Chin’s outspoken poetics on LGBTQ rights in the Caribbean and in other marginalized African diasporic communities.",,SOC,
ENGL,55.20,"The Case Study: Crime, Medicine, and Modern Society",Resvick,COLT 39.04,"What does Sherlock Holmes have in common with Sigmund Freud? What unites binge-worthy Netflix fare with Charles Dickens? The course investigates the case study, which plays a crucial role in criminal, legal, and medical contexts alike. While case studies are certainly familiar from tv series or podcasts, the form has a rich literary history. We will survey works from a range of national traditions, examining the features of the case that enable it to operate in and across multiple genres and fields. Our discussions will center on questions of epistemology and form, as we ask what kind of knowledge cases transmit and how they transmit it. Do they depict exceptional phenomena, or do they seek to delineate the qualities that are representative of a given phenomenon? Who has the authority to tell stories about whom? Why are cases so often relayed in serial form?",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,55.21,Epidemics: Vortex of Fear and Wisdom,,,"This course will focus on learning difficult lessons of experiential wisdom from global Infectious Disease Epidemics 1982-2020, including through on-the-ground experiences, literature, and documentaries.

ENGL,55.22,Socio/Poetics: Sociological Method and Literary Form,,,"This course introduces students to a cultural history of the relationship between Sociology and Literature in America from the early twentieth century to the present. Taking inspiration from recent scholarly approaches to literary interpretation that draw on sociological methods for interpreting texts quantitatively, relationally, and descriptively, we will also examine the ways in which sociology has long been occupied by phenomena often associated with literature: subjectivity, uncertainty, and linguistic form. Beginning with the institutionalization of sociology in the 1920s and 1930s, we will explore aesthetic texts alongside sociological works and other cultural documents. In doing so we will situate ourselves in a historical milieu and reconsider conventional literary categories and lineages such as documentary and docupoetry, the photo-essay, and New Journalism through the lens of their response to and use of sociological methods and tropes.",,LIT; WCult:W,

ENGL,61.01,Chaucer: Dream Poems and Troilus,,,"Chaucer's Canterbury Tales get all the hype, but his other works are every bit as exciting. From a gorgeously beautiful elegy (Book of the Duchess) to a biting satire (on fake news, no less—the House of Fame) to the engaging-but-problematic romance of Troilus and Criseyde, we will have multiple encounters with Chaucer's voice, his thought, his wit and humor. We will think about the intriguing genres of the Dream Poem and the Romance, both of which Chaucer complicates in interesting ways. We will also hone our research skills and talk about the conception and execution of a major literary paper. Prior knowledge of Middle English is not required.",Recommended: two completed English courses.,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,61.02,"Sound, Music, Literature in Medieval England",,,"In this course, we will consider various ways of approaching medieval literature as an acoustic event, and embedded in everyday soundscapes. We will introduce ourselves to the theory contemporary sound studies, and its practical and theoretical study in a medieval context. We will explore the connections between music, poetry, and oral performance of literary texts. Readings will range widely from Old English poems and epics to Middle English poems, plays, and romances. Our investigation will culminate in two of Chaucer's shorter poems, in which he specifically (and ironically) investigates the nature of sound and its social functions. At the same time, we will hone our research and paper-writing skills; each student will plan and execute an individual research project and present it to the class. ",Recommended: two completed English courses.,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,61.03,Early Modern Literature and the History of Sexuality,Ritger,,"Throughout the twentieth century and especially since the 1970s, the literature and drama of the English Renaissance has provided a crucial archive for scholars studying the historical formation of sexuality, sex practices, and gender in pre-modern society. Shakespeare's sonnets, for example, with their erotic address to both a ""sweet boy"" (or ""master-mistress of my passion"") and the so-called Dark Lady, remain a flashpoint. On the English stage, cross-gender identification and same-gender romance was a constant presence, while in the streets of London, ""catamites,"" ""tribades,"" or acts of ""sodomy"" were supposed to be completely absent—from the eyes of the law, at least. What can the poetry and plays of William Shakespeare, Amelia Lanyer, Christopher Marlowe, Margaret Cavendish, John Donne, or Katherine Phillips teach us, not only about the historically-distant practices of the past, but about our methods, theories, terms and changing paradigms for studying such topics today? What does it mean to read imaginative literature as an archive within an historically contingent body of knowledge? Students should prepare to engage with significant primary and secondary historical readings as well as the social theories of Michel Foucault, Eve Sedgwick, and others.",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,61.04,"Madness, Magic, Metamorphosis: Unstable Character in Early Modern Drama",,,"""Fair is foul and foul is fair,"" chant the witches of Shakespeare's MacBeth. Following their ominous words, this course explores how physical and psychic transformations reflect the uneasy coexistence of religion, myth, science, and the supernatural in Shakespeare's England. We begin with a slow reading of King Lear, in which a monarch's stormy madness destabilizes the natural world. Each week thereafter, we'll explore how playwrights use altered bodies and states of consciousness to reflect competing views of justice, truth, authority, and embodiment. As we test various critical approaches to the idea of literary character, we will weigh how well they account for the figures before us, who are defined by the mystical, the metaliterary, and the unnatural.",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,61.05,The Faerie Queene: Speculative Fiction circa 1590,Halasz,,"This course will read Edmund Spenser’s 16th century poem, The Faerie Queene, through the lens of the modern practices of speculative fiction, that is, fiction that explores or created alternative worlds. Despite the title of the poem, the queen never appears. Instead there are knights, ladies, magicians, mythic and fantastic beings, human-animal hybrids and robots (for starters) in a landscape that features a wide range of social relations and conditions. Shakespeare, Milton, James Joyce, Monty Python, Neil Gaiman, and Angela Carter are on the long list of the poem’s keen readers. In addition to The Faerie Queene, we’ll read short essays on speculative fiction and brief  extracts from 16th-18th century discussions of poetry as a way of writing and thinking.  Spenser’s language is deliberately archaic, but it is not difficult for modern readers. Experience with sixteenth century literature is not necessary.",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,61.11,Reel Imaginary: Early American Literature in Film,,,"Walter Benjamin argues that we can only awaken from “that dream we name the past” by passing through it, looking simultaneously at both past and future. We can attempt this by reading historical literature, but in the last few decades, film has become a major mediator of our experiences of the past. This course encourages us to think critically about how films represent our past to us in forms that shape our experience of our present identity and influence the future. To think dialectically, we will read primary source material from 1000 AD to 1757 and see what some of the major American filmmakers do with it and why.",Recommended: two completed English courses.,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,62.01,British Fictions of Revolution,,,"The year 1848 was, for most of Western Europe, a year of revolution. In England, one of the few countries to escape widespread violence, 1848 was a year of rampant publication. The texts published in the UK, ranging from Marx and Engels’ The Communist Manifesto to Gothic novels and Pre-Raphaelite poems, do not always seem obviously radical or even similar to one another in theme and mood. Are these texts in fact revolutionary? Are any of the texts politically or socially conservative, or do they represent conservative characters or perspectives? Do they take revolutionary forms or structures? To what extent are the texts participating in the same public sphere and historical moment? In responding to these questions, this colloquium will read literary texts (by Gaskell, Dickens, Emily Bronte, Christina Rossetti, Browning, and Tennyson) alongside artistic and political manifestos, popular political poetry, visual images, scientific and critical prose, and contemporary literary criticism (feminist, Marxist, psychoanalytic, poststructuralist). Students will work toward a substantial research project (12-15 pages) focused on a topic related to the course and of their choosing.",Recommended: two completed English courses.,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,62.02,The New Emily Dickinson: After the Digital Turn,,,"This colloquium offers an in-depth study of the poetry of Emily Dickinson with a particular focus on how the tools of the digital humanities have renovated our views, including unsettling just what a Dickinson poem is. Since her death in 1886, rival editors have fought over Dickinson’s canon, producing their versions of her poetry. Likewise, biographers have romanticized her life, characterizing her as “The Belle of Amherst,” eccentric, reclusive and even a bit mad. This colloquium will introduce students to the “new” Dickinson that is emerging from the plethora of materialist, feminist, post-modernist, and cultural studies approaches. We will use digital archives to reread and reconsider Dickinson’s work and life. Finally, we will study the year 1862, an immensely productive time for Dickinson and the height of the Civil War, also the focus of an annual daily blog I am preparing. For their final projects, students will examine one week of poetry in this tumultuous year, producing research that will be vetted for inclusion on the blog.",Recommended: two completed English courses.,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,62.03,Nineteenth-Century British Women Writers,,WGSS 48.09,"For the first time in literary history, women writers found commercial and critical success in England during the nineteenth century. Women writers of this time were keen observers of the social codes that formed—and constrained—their identities. Though women wrote in many genres in this period, this course will focus on major novels of the nineteenth century because of the particular strategies female novelists used to open up hard questions about social identity, and particularly social possibilities for women. Questions about gender clearly implicate sexuality, class, ethnicity, race, and power, as well, in complex, compelling, and unexpected ways. We will read works by Jane Austen, Mary Shelley, Emily Brontë, Charlotte Brontë, Elizabeth Gaskell, and George Eliot, and we will end the class by reading substantial excerpts from the private, unpublished diaries of the women writers who published as “Michael Field.” ",Recommended: Two completed English courses.,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,62.04,Trauma and Enjoyment in Early American Literature,Godley,,"Trauma is omnipresent today, but so is confusion about its signs, symptomatology, and long-term effects. Is trauma an event, a process, or a condition of being? Is sex or power more predominant in human relations? Why do we put ourselves in harm’s way despite our better intentions? Are life’s worst experiences always immitigable injustices, or are they potentially transformative? Early American literature might seem an unlikely guide here, but the distinction between violence and pleasurable excitation was crucial to the way American settlers encountered natives, how slavery became a definitive moral issue, and how literary history evolved from cautionary narratives of seduction to intensified engagements with reality. This dual survey course examines classic works of American literature from the first encounter to the Civil War, alongside pivotal works in trauma theory.",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,62.05,The Horrors of Survival: American Literatures of Modernity,,,"There is a significant period of modernization in US culture from about 1850-1920—a decade before the Civil War to the aftermath of World War I, encompassing Reconstruction, the Gilded Age, the devastating relocation of indigenous Americans, and the development of film and photography—which coincides with one of the most definitive and transformative passages in American self-identity, yet which is under-studied compared to the antebellum period (late 18th-early 19th century) and the period of “high modernism” (1920s-40s). Perhaps part of the reason is that what counts as modernity in these years is not yet modernism, but a process (always debatable) of “becoming-modern,” as if half the time there is a lingering preoccupation with pre-Civil War modes of life and the other half looks forward to a period of explosive economic growth and cultural change. Notably, this transitional period is when philosophical and scientific theories of survival, evolution, and inheritance of various sorts became predominant, alongside experiences of renewed racial violence, horrific catastrophes, economic turbulence, and political (dis)enfranchisement. By the early twentieth century, the psychiatric language of “trauma” dominated the understanding of subjectivity and the language of survival accordingly expands to include various forms of lingering, shock, strangeness, and disturbance that would soon take their place as hallmarks of the aesthetics of modernism. Tracking these currents, this course investigates episodes of survival from the personal (war, sexual assault, grief), the institutional (Jim Crow, Social Darwinism), historical (survivals of the Civil War, slavery) and media-technological (photography and film), in search of a definition of US modernity as a mode of transitional experience.",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,62.12,Jane Austen,McKee,,"As novels, and translated into film and television, Jane Austen's fiction has recently achieved extraordinary popularity, much greater than she experienced in her lifetime. In this course, discussions will focus on the times and the culture in which she wrote and on her more recent popularity.  Topics will include Austen's reactions against Romanticism; her continuing exploration of the moral and emotional dynamics of domestic life; her concern with the freedom of middle-class women; her use of history; her innovations in fictional narrative; and translations of her fiction into film.  We will read Northanger Abbey (written 1797, published 1818), Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814),  Emma (1816), and Persuasion, (written 1816, published 1818), and view film versions of Pride and Prejudice, Emma, and Persuasion.   Dist: LIT; WCult: W  Course Group II",Recommended: Two completed English courses.,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,62.16,Victorian Faces/Facial Politics,,,"In Victorian England, a person’s face was his or her calling card: a clue to social identity, a signifier of inner personality, or a mask, a socially-constructed and performed persona. The period witnessed the expansion of photography, the popularity of pseudo-sciences such as physiognomy and phrenology, and the “scientific” study of race—disciplines that focused on the policing of a material body. At the same time, the Victorian period witnessed the emergence of an alternative vector of realism that rejected an emphasis on the “seen” and expanded the categories of who and what could be represented: women, industrial workers, and people of color. In analyzing these competing fields of realism, this colloquium will read literary texts alongside artistic manifestos, scientific and pseudo-scientific prose, visual images, and contemporary literary criticism (poststructuralist, psychoanalytic, feminist, queer, performance theory, critical race). Possible authors include Mary Elizabeth Braddon, Elizabeth Gaskell, Charlotte Bronte, George Eliot, Amy Levy, and Bram Stoker.",Recommended: two completed English courses.,LIT; WCult:W,

From the recent Hollywood blockbuster 12 Years a Slave (2013) to the streets of Ferguson and Baltimore, the legacies of slavery and racial violence continue to cast their shadow over horizons of emancipationist history even as America commemorates the sesquicentennial of the U.S. Civil War. In this course we will revisit the literatures of slavery and antislavery in the Atlantic world from the eighteenth century to the present. Our novels and stories imagine episodes of slavery, slave rebellion, and fugitive flights to freedom across two centuries: from early transatlantic crossings of slaves and servants to the New World; to Tacky’s Revolt and its place in what Vincent Brown has recently called the “Coromantee Archipelago” in eighteenth century slave rebellion; to the spectacular soundings of the Haiti Revolution in the Age of Revolutions; to the messianic prophecies of Nat Turner in the early nineteenth century; to slave rebellions at sea; and finally to fugitive slave fictions in the abolitionist decade leading up to the Civil War. ",Recommended: Two completed English courses.,LIT; WCult:NW,

We will examine Morrison’s earliest and arguably most foundational and influential works. Required texts will include, The Bluest Eye, Sula, Song of Solomon, Tar Baby, Beloved, A Mercy, and Conversations with Toni Morrison. Central to our exploration will be an analysis of Morrison’s observation that “the past affects the present.” Therefore, we will explore the social and historical factors that contribute to Morrison’s artistic constructions. Some of the issues we will examine include, alternative constructions of female community and genealogy, and representations of race, class, nationhood, and identity.",Recommended: two completed English courses.,INT or LIT; WCult:CI,
ENGL,63.03,Fictions of Finance: For Love or Money,,,"Love or money? It is difficult to decide which of these forces influences our lives more greatly. While money may not buy happiness, love seldom manages to put food on the table. This course examines literary texts, films, and other kinds of cultural objects in which romance and finance overlap and come into conflict. It examines the ways in which both finance (especially speculation) and literature believe in the reality of fiction. The course broadly considers the social ramifications of the financialization of daily life, drawing on anthropology, sociology, political economy, and cultural studies to thicken our understanding of what it means to live in a world where finance determines so much. Students will have the opportunity to design a project dealing with issues of financial literacy. Possible readings/viewings include: Theodore Dreiser’s The Financier, Gary Shteyngart’s Super Sad True Love Story, William Gibson’s Peripheral, The Big Short (dir.

ENGL,63.04,Arts Against Empire: Fictions of Revolution and Solidarity in the Americas,Stuelke,LACS 30.12,"Anticolonial struggle and movements for social justice have always been accompanied by a range of cultural practices, including fiction, art, music, film, murals, theater, graffiti, and theory. This course explores that tradition of cultural activism, considering attempts to narrate revolutionary formation, imagine solidarity, and write decolonial theory. We will begin by examining revolutionary nationalist and anti-imperialist culture in the Americas—ranging from the memoirs of Che Guevara and Malcolm X to Nuyorican and Chicano Movement literature—in order to consider the formation of revolutionary subjects, and how 20th century ideas of revolution were raced and gendered. We will then consider how novelists, artists, photographers, filmmakers, and activists attempted to imagine solidarity with revolutionary movements and suffering others in the Americas, from Central America solidarity photography to performance art in solidarity with Guantanamo Bay prisoners. We will pay special attention to the work of feminist and queer solidarity artists, writers, and performers. Finally, we will examine contemporary activist cultural projects, such as PanAmerican public art road trips and hashtag-activism.

ENGL,63.06,The Undead South: Horror and Haunting in U.S. Southern Literature,Benson Taylor,,"This course explores the many forms of horror and haunting—racial, cultural, historic, economic, political—in the region known as the U.S. South, a national space where the possibilities of regeneration are continually thwarted by the aftershocks of a harrowing past. “Undead” tropes encompass numerous varieties of posthumous horror: the dead rising from graves; mourning and funerary practices; the glorification of lost causes and heroes; the excavation of unsuccessfully repressed crimes and bodies. We will consider both traditional forms of Gothic representation (in works by Poe, O’Connor, Faulkner, etc.) as well as contemporary resurgences in the vampires, zombies, and other necrotic forms of recent literature, television, film, and other media. Along the way, we will seek to identify the disturbing ways that the U.S. South has served—both consensually and coercively—as a kind of purgatorial space for America’s most haunting histories.",Recommended: two completed English courses,LIT; WCult:W,

What motivates “give and take” between individuals culturally or geographically distant, or separated by wealth?  World fiction that grapples with these questions will provide queues for reflection on the ethics and pragmatics of cosmopolitanism. The readings imagine forms of friendship, dialogue, love, and goodwill which will be assessed against Enlightenment, Post-Enlightenment, and Democratic conceptions of rights, property, and community.",Recommended: two completed English courses.,INT or LIT; WCult:NW,

We will examine questions of gender and sexuality, kinship and belonging, desire and the erotic, and history and futurity through readings in fiction, poetry, and drama alongside key works in the history of gender and sexuality, queer theory, and queer of color critique. Students will also develop critical skills and strategies for producing scholarship in literary and cultural studies, culminating in an original research paper.",,LIT; WCult:CI,
ENGL,63.10,Contemporary Science Fiction,Clark,,"In this course, students will read a wide selection of speculative fiction written since the 1980s, and mostly in the past decade. These texts imagine the births of artificial minds and bodies and the deaths of natural worlds, voyages through outer space and travels through time.

ENGL,63.11,"Race, Sex, Sensation",,,"This course engages with theories of race, sex, and sensation in critical race and ethnic studies, black and women of color feminism, and postcolonial studies. How does the violence enacted on racialized, sexed, gendered subjects exclude such subjects from the category of the individual, rights-bearing human cemented in Western philosophy? How is this exclusion enacted on the very surface of the skin and distinctly felt on one’s body? Who gets to claim humanity and subjecthood, and who has never been able to make such a claim? The readings in this course give an account of how racialized, sexed, gendered subjects are made to bear histories of enslavement, dispossession, genocide, and colonialism in ways that might not always be visible, but instead are sensed, felt, and embodied. We will work with literature, performance, and art that elucidates the political, social, and aesthetic possibilities found in the nonhuman, animality, objecthood, flesh, viscera, and touch.",,LIT; WCult:CI,

Utilized in the creative realm to create a representation of the artist as both subject and object, self-portraits can be whimsical, grim, tantalizing, performative, or combative. In this course we will examine gendered constructions of self- portraiture as they exist in poetry, memoir, and photography. Specifically, our task will be to examine the registers of possibility present when women use their bodies and stories to claim authorial space. Our goal during the term will be to think through all of the mechanisms of the self that are deployed in the context of artistic practice.

This course explores the psychoanalytic case study as a unique literary genre in its own right, one that falls between the medical case history and the novel proper. We will read Sigmund Freud's case studies through three modes of reading: psychoanalytic feminist criticism; paranoid and reparative reading from queer critique; and, symptomatic reading from Marxist criticism. The readings of the cases will therefore be supplemented by texts in queer and feminist theory, continental philosophy, and literary criticism. Throughout the quarter, we will use the cases to explore questions of racial and sexual difference, the body, trauma, the psyche, and memory.",Recommended: two completed English courses.,LIT; WCult:W,

In the course, we will engage with Derrida’s archive by reading some of the interviews that he gave over the course of his life, from the very early interviews on philosophy, philosophical heritage, and the status of writing in western thought to his late interviews, which focus more on ethics, the political, sexual difference, the animal, and the death penalty. Throughout the course of the term, we will study the method of deconstruction, placing Derrida’s thought within a philosophical and literary archive and exploring the potentiality of deconstruction towards an ethical and political project.

The course is located at the intersection of literature, psychoanalysis, and critical theory and will act both as introduction to psychoanalytic thought as well as its unique development by Lacan.

Do plants have a kind of sentience? Given that we can never get inside the head (or leaf) of another species, can we really know anything about their consciousness? Writers and theorists have been asking these questions for centuries, often in dialogue with the science of animal behavior. This course looks at a contemporary multidisciplinary tradition that attributes sentience and communication to animals, plants, and fungi. Over the course of the term, we address three interlocking problems as they appear in a varied archive of print and visual media 1) the problem of accessing the subjective experience of other species 2) the problem of communicating with other species, and the question in what media it might be possible 3) the problem of communicating with other human beings about 1 and 2, and the question of what media best serve this purpose. We also ask what these aesthetic and theoretical traditions offer us now, during the “Anthropocene” or the current epoch when humans have become a geological force shaping the Earth. We ask whether or not they have the potential to interpret it from a different perspective, whether or not they can inform environmentalist politics, and what their implications might be for social justice.

Students in this class will study the works of some of the canonical figures in that centuries-old tradition — Plato, Aristotle, St. Augustine, Kant, Schiller, Hegel, Nietzsche — alongside some other figures, such as Matthew Arnold, T. S. Eliot, and Erich Auerbach, who fall just outside the literary-theoretical canon but whose influence on literary studies has nonetheless been profound.

ENGL,64.08,Matters of Life and Death: A Theory Course,,,"The universal right to live is one of the basic precepts of modern morality. But everyone knows that this sole declaration guarantees nothing, that too often this principle, and the idea that life is inherently valuable, has been made into an alibi behind which atrocities are committed, such as murderous colonial practices, racially motivated executions, human bondage, cultures of rape, and war profiteering. But hypocrisy or faithlessness aside, is it possible that we have never really understood what we mean when we speak of an entitlement to life, or even the value of life such? If life is valuable, and supremely significant, could it be because we think nonliving matter is without value? And yet, no living being is entirely independent of the nonliving—we are composed as much of nonliving matter as of thriving communities of microorganisms. Moreover, as subjects of law, institutions, and culture, we regularly invest ourselves in non-vital symbolic systems that will outlive us, like building a future for others or leaving a legacy behind. And just as often, these symbolic forms of life can be used against the living and decide the conditions of what counts as life. In this course, we will rigorously inquire about the hidden processes behind the ""mattering"" of lives (and deaths) in different contexts. Consulting works of philosophy and theory, as well as a few literary “cases,” we will explore topics such as nihilism, the impact of capital on the “worth” of existence, the value of nonwhite lives, the death drive, suicide, the politics of grieving, and the pursuit of death as a way of life. ",,TMV; WCult:W,
ENGL,65.01,Walking,Edmondson,,"Students in this course will circle around a set of deceptively simple questions, all of them framed by an overarching question: What does it mean to walk? Should walking be regarded as a fundamental human activity or as a literary convention carried over into everyday life? Why has walking long been regarded as a vehicle for thought and discourse: a privileged mechanism of knowledge production? Is there a difference between a country walk and a city walk? What is the relationship between walking and time, walking and place? Why should walking have emerged, in certain works of contemporary literature, as a principled rejection of mechanization, modernity, and the capitalist mode of production? And what does walking mean for those who cannot walk? To address these questions, students will read texts by such practitioners and theorists of walking as Thoreau, Walter Benjamin, W. G.

Making literature through computational techniques opens up a range of expressive possibilities and encourages us to refine our intuitions about style and form. This activity—at minimum, a collaboration between one human and one machine—also invites us to imagine increasingly diverse and complex ways of dividing the labor of literary production. Throughout the course, we will consider examples of computer-generated poems and fiction as well as literary bots and interfaces. No programming experience is expected, though seasoned programmers are welcome.",Recommended: Two completed English courses.,TLA,
ENGL,65.06,"The Poetry and Rhetoric of Love, from Petrarch to Social Media",Zeiger,WGSS 53.05,"What we call ""love poetry"" has generally been a way of expressing much more than the emotional and erotic fascination of one person with another. Often it seems to bypass the love-object altogether, and focuses instead on power relations or poetic achievement. Beginning with early examples, and moving on to contemporary and modern poems, our course will place love poems by men and women in the context of an ongoing poetic tradition, recent feminist criticism and theory, and talk about love and sex in recent popular culture. This last will include: excerpts from recent books about dating and seduction, film, contemporary song lyrics, dating websites, and campus culture.",Recommended: Two completed English courses.,,

ENGL,71.01,"Celtic Fringes: Medieva English Literature in Dialogue with Irish, Welsh, and Breton Traditions",,,"From Arthur and Merlin to prophecy, poetry, and song, the literatures of medieval England drew heavily on the lively, imaginative, and sophisticated traditions of their Celtic neighbors, their musical styles and the particular aesthetic they brought to their poetry and narrative.   In this course we will study some pairings of connected Celtic and English/Anglo-Norman texts, as well as contemporary writing about the Celtic connection. The politics of these exchanges are not easy. There were wars and border skirmishes; the Norman and Angevin kings of England sought to subdue the Celtic kingdoms and extend their political influence by diplomacy, coercion and conquest, creating a dynamic that is in some ways parallel to, but also interestingly different from a modern Colonial/Postcolonial situation.  Readings may include early Arthurian material; Diarmaid and Grainne and the Anglo-French Tristan romances; Geoffrey of Monmouth's Life of Merlin and Merlinesque prophecies; the Welsh Mabinogi; lais by Marie de France and other writers; the borderland romance ""Fulk Fitz Warren""; the anecdotes, satires and short romances of Walter Map; Gerald of Wales's ethnographic descriptions/ travelogues of Wales and Ireland.  All non-English texts will be read in translation, although students with some knowledge of French, Latin, or a Celtic language may wish to explore some readings in the original. Enrollment limited to 12.",Recommended: Four completed English courses.,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,71.02,Ovid in England,,,"Englishing Ovid was something every advanced schoolboy in the16th century did: translating passages; composing speeches for characters from the poems; dramatizing and performing (in Latin, in England) Ovidian scenes. In this seminar we'll read Ovid's Heroides and Metamorphoses in the sixteenth and early seventeenth century print translations alongside a modern English edition. (Students competent in Latin may use the Loeb as well as or instead of the modern English.) We'll consider the forms, themes, and predicaments Ovid's great mythographic poems offered to the English literary imagination. Some attention will be paid to late 20th century performative and poetic ""englishings"" of Ovid.",Recommended: Four completed major courses.,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,71.03,The Faerie Queene,,,"We’ll spend the term reading Spenser’s great epic romance, The Faerie Queene. It’s a wonderful poem, deeply engaged with philosophical, poetic, ethical, and political issues via compelling stories, fantastic settings, and provocative descriptions. Shakespeare, Milton, James Joyce, Monty Python and Neil Gaiman are on the long list of the poem’s keen readers. Experience with sixteenth century literature is not required. Spenser's language is deliberately archaic at times, but it is not difficult for modern readers. Discussion, informal writing, short papers (2-3pp), oral presentations, and an open topic essay leading to a final paper.",Four completed English courses or permission of the instructor.,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,71.05,Romance in Medieval England,,,"This course explores the diverse and elusive genre we now call “romance,” a capacious term that covers anything from chivalric adventures and love stories to quasi-hagiographic and pseudo-historical narratives, from a variety of historical and theoretical perspectives. Readings may include Middle English and Anglo-Normal romances such as Tristan, Havelock and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and selections from later Arthurian narratives. ",Four completed English courses or permission of the instructor.,LIT; WCult:W,

ENGL,71.13,Gender and Power in Shakespeare,,,"The course will begin by defining the varieties of power inscribed in Shakespeare’s plays, and proceed to explore the following questions. Is language gender-inflected? Do men and women speak ""different"" languages? How do power and gender affect each other? How do women negotiate power among themselves? How do men? How is power exerted and controlled in sexual relationships? How do unspoken social definitions exert their power over the politics of gender? Possible works studied will be drawn from The Rape of Lucrece, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, The Taming of the Shrew, The Merchant of Venice, Much Ado About Nothing, As You Like It, All’s Well That Ends Well, Othello, Macbeth, Troilus and Cressida, Coriolanus, Antony and Cleopatra, and The Winter’s Tale.",Four completed English courses or permission of the instructor.,LIT,
ENGL,71.14,"Knights, Camelot, Action!",Edmondson,,"This course will introduce students to medieval romance, one of the most popular genres of medieval literature and one that gives us some of the best-loved literary characters of all time. We will study the genre of romance, including Arthurian romance and other varieties, from the genre’s inception. We will pay particular attention to the form of story-telling that it popularizes, the concept of love that it systematizes, and the notion of heroism on which it depends. We will privilege English romance and will therefore read many texts in their original Middle English.",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,71.15,Poetics of the Supernatural,Beckman,,"“The instruments of darkness tell us truths,” warns Shakespeare’s Macbeth. While the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries took a complex view of the occult—witch-hunts spawned widescale bloodshed while alchemy paved the way for modern chemistry—this senior seminar examines how Renaissance writers used supernatural events to interrogate social structures of power and identity. Closely reading poetry and drama by Shakespeare and his contemporaries, we will ask how transformations, hauntings, and spells productively trouble categories of gender, temporality, ecology, and the human. Working with early modern historical archives and literary experiments, from week to week we will be challenged to consider how imaginative fiction, perhaps even more than realism, captures the tension and possibility that define eras of radical cultural change.",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,72.02,"Decadence, Degeneration and the Fin de Siecle",,COLT 49.05,"The end of the nineteenth century saw the emergence of genuinely mass readerships, but it also saw the development of literary forms that pitted themselves against the commercialization and homogenization of literary culture. In this course we will look at so-called decadent writers and artists who imagined heightened forms of aesthetic experience in order to displace the political and sexual norms of their societies. We will also examine the controversies their work evoked and the theories of degeneration, deviance and abnormality that were frequently deployed to explain their excesses. Texts will include Oscar Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray, J.K. Huysmans’s Against Nature, Marie Corelli’s Wormwood, and Bram Stoker’s Dracula.",Recommended: Four completed major courses.,LIT,
ENGL,72.03,Bohemia: Glamorous Outcasts & the Nineteenth-Century Novel,,,"Bohemia - an urban underworld of social outcasts, struggling artists, and political conspirators - is one of the most enduring fantasies to emerge out of the nineteenth century. By the 1890s, the figure of the Bohemian had become central to a cosmopolitan literary culture eager to assert its autonomy from the marketplace and restrictive notions of nationality. It had also become bound up with a range of anxieties fixated on cultural decadence, racial degeneration, transgressive sexuality, political revolution and the occult. This course will study a series of novels that foreground these issues, including Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray, George Gissing's New Grub Street, George Du Maurier's Trilby and Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent. We will also glance ahead to early twentieth-century texts like Henry Miller’s The Tropic of Cancer. ",Recommended: Four completed major courses.,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,72.05,1850s America,,,"What can the literature of a single decade tell us? From The Scarlet Letter (1850) and Uncle Tom’s Cabin (1851-52) to Leaves of Grass (1855) and Lincoln’s “House Divided” Speech of 1858, the literary output of America in the 1850s provides us with a snapshot of a turbulent culture amidst unprecedented growth and crisis. Slavery and xenophobia, minstrelsy and mass entertainments, crowds, consumerism, and cities, the “woman question,” labor rights, economic panics, and the secularization of Christian sentiment—these are just some of the issues that clamor in the literature of the decade. Our texts shall represent the gorgeous miscellany that is the 1850s, drawing from both high and low culture, canonical and forgotten authors, and from both established genres and media like novels and slave narratives to more ephemeral ones like newspapers, almanacs, caricatures, and inscribed material objects. Classes will meet in Rauner so that we may use these and other period rarities to spawn discussion and topics for original, independent research. In addition to the rich content of the texts themselves (their historical contexts and theoretical possibilities), another object of inquiry shall be the nature of literary history itself.",Recommended: Four completed English courses.,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,72.06,Dickens in Context,Dever,,"This class will focus on the work of Charles Dickens in two distinct contexts. First, we will spend the term engaging in an intensive, deliberately slow reading of Dickens’s Bleak House, which was published from March, 1852 to September, 1853, in 20 monthly parts. By spreading our reading of this long, complex novel over the span of the fall term, we will gain access to something like the experience of its first readers, who encountered the text in units of several chapters, separated by time. Second, we will put Dickens and Bleak House in conversation with three other novelists and novels that shared the moment in the marketplace: Elizabeth Gaskell’s Cranford, published serially and edited by Dickens in 1851-52, Charlotte Brontë’s Villette, published in 1853, and Anthony Trollope’s Barchester Towers, published in 1855. Through work in Rauner Library, we will learn about the material history of literary production in the mid-Victorian period, and through engagement with contemporary critical and theoretical texts, we will learn about the implications of the narrative experiments Dickens, Gaskell, Brontë, and Trollope undertook in the 1850s. Though reading for the course will be demanding, keeping up will be rewarded with ample room for lively in-class discussions.",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,72.09,Ecocriticism,,,"Recent critics have argued that our image of “nature” as static and separate from humans is our chief stumbling block in cultivating ecological thought.  In this course, we will read literature from the eighteenth century to track the emergence andenvironmental legacy of developments such as the Industrial Revolution and the Anthropocene, the geological epoch in which humans became the primary driver of climate change.  Topics will include the vogue for georgic poetry, the aesthetics of the sublime, colonial expansion, the rise of natural history, it-narratives and thing theory, and questions of the animal.  We will read contemporary theory about ecology and object-oriented ontology in the context of the eighteenth century and twenty-first century environmental concerns.",Recommended: Four completed major courses.,LIT,
ENGL,72.13,The Brontës,Harner,,"Who were the Brontës and why have their novels remained so popular? What do their texts tell us about Victorian discourses on childhood, gender, space and psycho-geographies, class discontent, empire and globalization, labor and industry, religion, creativity, and language? What do we gain or lose by studying their biographies: tales of four siblings living in isolation on the Yorkshire moors, publishing pseudonymously, and dying young? In this course, we will look closely at the literary production of the Brontës, beginning with the fantastical tales and poetry they wrote as young adults. Topics will include female labor, evangelicalism, the Victorian Gothic, marriage and women’s legal rights, storytelling and myth, colonialism, feminized and racialized madness, and the physical and psychological contours of domestic and foreign space.",Recommended: Four completed major courses.,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,72.14,"From Riches to Rags: Poverty in American Literature, 1861-1925",Boggs,,"From accounts about the streets being paved with gold to tales that take characters from rags to riches, success stories form an important part of American literary and national identity. Some eras especially seem to embrace such narratives, such as the “Gilded Age” which owes its name to Mark Twain. Yet the term itself was tongue-in-cheek, and many of the works produced in that “age” are as -- if not more -- concerned with rags than riches. Taking material possessions – or their absence – as a lens through which to examine economic and cultural conditions, these texts don’t work from as much as they work towards a definition of what poverty is and what it does – to individual people and whole classes (with gender and race as salient categories). In this class, we will read key literary works, especially in the genres of Realism and Naturalism, alongside theoretical texts to shed new light on the way in which American Literature portrays, critiques, embraces as well as reimagines the material and cultural conditions of Americans’ lives and livelihoods.",,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,73.01,"In the Image: Photography, Writing, and the Documentary Turn",Sharlet,,"In 1942, the literary critic Alfred Kazin dismissed the documentary movement of the 1930s as a ""sub-literature,"" a ""vast granary of facts"" from which poets and fiction writers might extract the raw material of true literature. Just a year before, though, James Agee and Walker Evans -- a journalist and photographer -- had published Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, a vast book, indeed, sprawling in its feverish devotion to the experimentation Agee and Evans believed necessary to even come close to telling a true story. Agee and Evans wanted it to be an object as much as a book, a challenge to literary culture; whatever it was, it wasn't ""sub"" anything. In this course we'll use the question of just what Agee's and Evan's combination of pictures and words might be as the heart of our exploration of the documentary sphere as encountered through the conjunction of text and image. In the first half of the course, we’ll be guided by critical thinkers as we look at creative works and write our own critical essays; in the second, we’ll be guided by creative work as we attempt our own even while we continue our conversations with more contemporary critical thinkers. Besides Agee and Evans, we’ll be encountering among others, photographers Robert Frank, Sally Mann, Stephen Shore, Helen Levitt, Wendy Ewald, Teju Cole, Jean Mohr, Tanja Hollander, and Roy DeCarava; literary journalists Leslie Jamison, Michael Lesy, John Jeremiah Sullivan, John Berger, and Charles Bowden; critics Susan Sontag, Roland Barthes, John Szarkowski, Jerry Thompson, Susie Linfield, Jeff Allred, and bell hooks; and poets Claudia Rankine, Marianne Moore, Langston Hughes, Donald Justice, and Kevin Young.",Recommended: Four completed English courses.,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,73.02,Toni Morrison Senior Seminar,Moodie,,"This course is an in-depth study of Toni Morrison’s major fictional works. We will examine Morrison’s earliest and arguably most foundational and influential novels. We will also read critical responses to Morrison’s works. Required texts will include, The Bluest Eye, Sula, Song of Solomon, Tar Baby, Beloved, A Mercy, Conversations with Toni Morrison, and selected essays. Central to our exploration will be an analysis of Morrison’s observation that “the past affects the present.” Therefore, we will explore the social and historical factors that contribute to Morrison’s artistic constructions. Some of the issues we will examine include, alternative constructions of female community and genealogy, and representations of race, class, nationhood, and identity.",Recommended: Four completed major courses.,LIT; WCult:CI,
ENGL,73.05,Global Anglophone Nobel Prize Writers,Moodie,,"A study of Nobel Prize writers from various Anglophone countries, this course examines authors' aesthetic innovations alongside their engagement in cultural, socio-political, and national discourses. Although the focus will be on poetry, the course will also explore the relationship between different genres (including essays, plays, and novels) and various socio-historical moments. Authors will include William Faulkner, Nadine Gordimer, Seamus Heaney, Wole Soyinka, Rabindranath Tagore, Derek Walcott, Patrick White, and W.B. Yeats.",Recommended: Four completed major courses.,LIT,
ENGL,73.07,Poetry of Elizabeth Bishop,,,"An orphan, a female poet, a lesbian, a long-term expatriate in Brazil, Elizabeth Bishop is nowhere definitively at home; for a long time, literary criticism had trouble accommodating her as well. Recently, queer, feminist, and postcolonial analyses have provided a new critical context for this elusive poet; we will read widely in this work, while focusing on Bishop's poems, drafts, and letters. We will also consider her relationships with contemporaries like Moore and Lowell. ",Recommended: Four completed major courses.,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,73.13,James Joyce,,,"This seminar will be devoted to the study of Joyce's Ulysses. After some discussion of Joyce's Portrait and Dubliners -- both of which students are urged to read before the course begins--we will focus on the text of Joyce's Ulysses, with an emphasis on close reading and an examination of Joyce's experiments in prose and his place in modern literature.  ",Recommended: Four completed major courses.,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,73.19,Faulkner,,,"Although he never received a college degree and lived most of his life in a small town in one of the most impoverished states in the nation, William Faulkner is now acclaimed throughout the world as one of the greatest modern writers. In this seminar, we will focus on Faulkner's fiction and on its place in the history of modernism. Particular attention will be given to the importance of Southern history and Southern legends, which are inseparable in the fiction from the experiences of individual and family life. We will read The Sound and the Fury, As I Lay Dying, Absalom Absalom!, Light in August, Go Down, Moses, and The Hamlet and study the work of critics who have debated the meanings of Faulkner’s art, especially, for recent critics, the importance of race to the stories he tells.",Recommended: Four completed major courses.,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,73.28,How We Live Now: Contemporary Hemispheric Fictions,,,"This course explores contemporary hemispheric fiction and film’s attempts to represent how we live now: to map the economic and cultural changes of the last forty years, including the death of 1960s social movements and the shift to a new form of global capitalism. Throughout the course, we will consider the inter-Americanism of these works, exploring how these authors grapple with parallel and overlapping historical conditions, and attend particularly to questions of form and genre. We will consider how genres like chick lit and detective fiction might solicit readers to think and feel in ways that are in line with national and multinational economic imperatives, but also how authors have attempted to create new forms to describe and challenge contemporary conditions of work, war, debt, and depression. Authors may include Roberto Bolaño, Terry McMillan, Junot Diaz, Claudia Rankine, Alicia Gaspar de Alba, Karen Russell, Eden Robinson, and César Aira. ",Recommended: Four completed English courses.,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,73.30,20th Century Protest Poetry,,AAAS 91.02,"In light of recent protest movements that target issues of race and gender, the prescient words of numerous artists continue to be evoked and volleyed about in contemporary media outlets. Yet the contexts of many of these utterances are largely ignored. Delving into some of these contexts and engaging many of these artists’ larger oeuvre, this course is a multidisciplinary investigation of major protest poets of the twentieth century. It explores the ways in which poets living in the United States, and particularly members of historically marginalized communities, not only pushed back at the powers-that-be, but continuously saw and articulated themselves as simultaneously a part of and a part from larger “American” society. The course wrestles with the well-known and often contentious topics: race, class, and gender. Starting with turn-of-the-century writers like Claude McKay—whose words have become synonymous with outspoken critiques of World War I and the “Red Scare”—and ending with contemporary writers like Balakian and Chin, the course moves chronologically. Some of the writers it examines include, Peter Balakian, Amiri Baraka, Staceyann Chin, Lucille Clifton, Mayda Del Valle, Karen Garrabrant, Allen Ginsberg, Zbignew Herbert, Robert Lowell, Juan Felipe Herrera, Langston Hughes, Etheridge Knight, Denise Levertov, Haki Madhubuti, Jill McDonough, Claude McKay, Alice Notley, Emmy Perez, Adrienne Rich, Sylvia Plath, Sonia Sanchez, and Dorothy Tse.  ",Recommended: Four completed major courses.,LIT; WCult:CI,
ENGL,74.01,Reading Freud,,,"Why read Freud? Many of his most famous ideas (the Oedipus Complex, for example) have been discredited, disparaged, devalued, decried. So why read Freud? Using that question — a question that, in its very persistence, already crystalizes all that is most troubling, provocative, and intriguing about the Freudian text — students in this class will read Freud for his enduring value as the inventor, in psychoanalysis, of one of modernity’s most disturbing art forms, as an influential theorist of figuration and representation, as a fearless inquirer into the mysteries of gender and sexuality, and as a speculative thinker who continues to have a hold on our imagination precisely because he could never quite come to grips with all that had a hold on his imagination. Above all, we shall read Freud for what he has to teach us about the importance of risking failure and embarrassment, of remaining restless and uncertain in respect to one’s own thinking, of finding oneself in over one’s head. The texts we shall use to pursue this line of inquiry may or may not include any of the following: Studies on Hysteria, The Interpretation of Dreams, Three Essays on Sexuality, the case histories of Dora and the Wolf Man, Papers on Metapsychology and on Technique, Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Inhibitions, Symptoms and Anxiety, Civilization and Its Discontents, and essays such as “Project for a Scientific Psychology,” “Screen Memories,” “The Uncanny,” “The Moses of Michelangelo,” “On Narcissism,” “Two Principles of Mental Functioning,” “A Child Is Being Beaten,” “The Economic Problem of Masochism,” “Constructions in Analysis,” “Analysis Terminal and Interminable,” and “Humor.”      ",Recommended: Four completed English courses.,LIT; WCult:W,
ENGL,74.02,Understanding Biopolitics,,,"Biopolitics, loosely defined as the reciprocal incorporation of politics and life, describes not merely the dominant form that politics takes today but also, arguably, the form that politics has always taken. Healthcare, reproduction, immigration, security, racialization, risk management, emotional wellbeing, property and the common: There is no aspect of embodied existence that has not been affected, if not created (or at least grasped), by biopolitics. Nevertheless, the concept of biopolitics itself, introduced into the critical lexicon by Foucault and still subject to revision and working-through, remains far from settled. Accordingly, students in this seminar will read foundational texts of the burgeoning biopolitical canon — texts by Foucault, Arendt, Agamben, Esposito, Hardt and Negri, to name but a few — as a way of understanding biopolitics not as the basis for a new epistemology but as the term we accord a set of predicaments that emerge at the point where politics and life intercept one another. To facilitate that understanding, students will rely on the texts collected in Biopolitics: A Reader, supplemented by Esposito’s Terms of the Political and Melinda Cooper’s Life as Surplus. For their final paper, students will have the option of writing either an essay assessing the treatment of a biopolitical predicament across a range of texts or a biopolitical case study.   ",Recommended: Four completed English courses.,LIT; WCult:CI,
ENGL,74.03,On Cruelty,,,"What is cruelty? How can we understand the relation between cruelty and other forms of violence, such as sadism, masochism, and terrorism, all of which straddle the difficult boundary between pleasure and displeasure, enjoyment and pain. In this course, we will explore the concept of cruelty through a study of literary, filmic, psychoanalytic, and philosophical texts. We will also interrogate how appeals to cruelty underwrite various rights discourses, including debates on the death penalty, human and animal rights, and various international treatises that put a limit on the violence of war. Authors will include: Marquis de Sade, Antonin Artaud, Richard von Krafft-Ebing, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari.

The “bildungsroman,” or novel of ""coming to age,""  is a novelistic genre that arose in the late 18th century to answer precisely that question, by using stories of young protagonists to imagine the optimal path to happiness. In this class, we will familiarize ourselves with texts considered “exemplary” of the bildungsroman in the Western tradition, then turn to non-Western narratives of youth to compare different conceptions of the link between youth and happy living.

Word-image theory seeks to understand these entanglements, analyzing the conceptual intersections of the literary and the visual. In this seminar, students will be invited to re-conceptualize those intersections by becoming familiar with the core arguments of word-image studies, iconology, picture theory, and visual culture studies.

In the course, we will read Fanon’s early essays on black subjectivity in Black Skin, White Masks; his more overtly political writings on violence and revolution in Wretched of the Earth; and, his clinical writings on madness, institutionalization, and psychotherapy, collected in the newly translated Alienation and Freedom. Throughout the course of the term, we will pay close attention to questions of racial and sexual difference in Fanon’s work as well as the way his writing remains critical for postcolonial political thought.",,LIT; WCult:NW,

How does the specter of species death and global pandemonium have a literary and cultural history as well as a geophysical, earth systems one? This seminar, through historical and contemporary critique, read transversally across an array of media from novels to theory and film, will situate where we are now with literature from the past about the emergence of steam power, land enclosures, energy systems, and Arctic exploration to account for how we might secure the future. Topics include entanglements of anthopogenic processes with other planetary effects in theories of Capitalocene, Plantationocene, and Chthulucene from the conquest of the Americas to the untimely present.

This course will serve as an introduction to some of the methods and concerns of contemporary Critical Prison Studies, as well as a deep dive into the historical rise of carceral institutions in England and the United States, as seen from the perspective of incarcerated writers, and as reimagined in literary texts. Famous examples such as the prison epistles of Oscar Wilde will be set alongside more recent rediscoveries, such as the manuscripts of Austin Reed. Readings from Angela Davis, Michel Foucault, and Nicole Fleetwood (among others) will frame our comparative inquiry; classics such as Robinson Crusoe will be cast in a different light. Recurring topics will include writings from confinement as genre; the importance of print culture inside and outside the prison; the relation between carceral institutions and literary genres such as the convict narrative, epistle, early realist novel, and lyric poem. Throughout we will pay particular attention to how literary writing has been a recurring means for thinking outside the confines of a given political discourse, while we also reconsider the links between confinement and imagination, rehabilitation and subjectivity, art and liberation, then and now.",,LIT; WCult:W,

ENGL,92,English Study Abroad III,Schweitzer,,"One college credit (not major or minor credit) for this course is awarded to students who satisfactorily complete a course of study elected as part of one of the Department's two Foreign Study Programs (FSPs). The purpose of English 92, when taken in Glasgow, is to enhance the experience of studying English and Scottish literature in a European, and more specifically British, context. The requirement may be fulfilled by taking a course, approved by the program director, in Scottish literature or culture, British cultural history, Celtic civilization, comparative literature, or the English language. Other courses relevant to the study of English literature (in art history, philosophy or media studies, for instance) may be taken subject to the approval of the English Department's Committee on Departmental Curriculum. ENGL 92 on the Glasgow FSP satisfies no distributive requirement. On the Dublin FSP, this will be a course of study in the English Department at Trinity College Dublin (TCD).
